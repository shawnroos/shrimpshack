  Drive an auto run: chain the plan-loop → seam → work-loop using the
  self-pacing tick (lib/tick.py), the agent-managed orchestrator
  (lib/orchestrator.py), and a deliberate-stop /goal binding. Use when
  invoked via /auto, when continuing after a seam, or when resuming a
  run. This skill IS the driving agent: arms the tick chain, decides
  the work-loop fan-out cap per wave (resizable in flight), reads the
  ledger's cached exit predicate to know when the loop is done. NEVER
  re-evaluates the predicate itself.

# auto (loop driver)

**Prepare/execute, ledger-anchored.** This skill PREPARES intents; the
model EXECUTES them. Re-ticking without running the prepared
invocation is a no-op. Source of truth is the disk ledger at
`<repo>/.claude/auto/<run>.json`; the conversation is advisory. Full
contract + traps (bash-loop, deepen↔review livelock):
`docs/contracts/driver-reference.md` §1.

## 1. Goal binding

Every `/auto` run is goaled before arming.

- **Default:** the loop's exit predicate — *until only P3 findings
  remain* (`exit_predicate_result.met` becomes true).
- **Compound** (operator-supplied via `--goal`): honor verbatim; bind
  to BOTH the loop's `met` AND the operator's clause.

Auto uses its own Stop hook (`lib/on-stop.py` via
`lib/goal-status.py`); native `/goal` is model-judged with no external
predicate seam. Ensure `loop.driver` reflects state (`"self"` /
`"manual"`) and the goal is active. Never proceed un-goaled. Full
mechanism: `driver-reference.md` §3.

## 2. Arm the tick chain

Fire the first tick:

```
ScheduleWakeup(delay=60, prompt="/auto-tick <run>")
```

`ScheduleWakeup` clamps delay to `[60, 3600]s`. Each tick returns a
re-arm intent dict on stdout; the driver acts on it. Phase-aware
dispatch:

| `action` | phase | what you do |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `rearm`  | `plan` | `ScheduleWakeup(intent.delay, intent.prompt)` — short delay |
| `rearm`  | `work` | YIELD; harness re-invokes on next verdict. LONG ScheduleWakeup (1200s+) ONLY when no work in flight AND no ready units (genuinely stalled) |
| `stop`   | any   | chain ends; do NOT re-arm. `predicate-met*` → report (§5); `seam-pause` → surface seam (§3) |
| `noop`   | any   | another live tick holds the lock; do nothing |

Never re-arm on `stop` / `noop`. Never short-poll the work-loop.

## 3. Seam

When plan predicate met:

- **Not `auto`** (operator passed `--review-plan`): tick writes
  `loop_phase = "seam"`, `seam_paused = true`, returns `stop`,
  `reason == "seam-pause"`. Surface the plan + parallelism analysis.
  Resume via `/auto-resume continue <run>` (→ work) or
  `/auto-resume abort <run>` (→ done).
- **`auto`** (v0.4.0 default): tick that closes plan predicate flips
  `plan → work` directly and keeps re-arming. No pause.

## 4. Work-loop fan-out (event-driven)

The harness re-invokes you when a background `Agent` finishes — that
IS the wake signal. Per wave:

1. `units = orchestrator.ready_units(repo, run)`.
2. Decide cap for THIS wave (16 idle / 3 grinding / 1 to serialize —
   no fixed constant).
3. `orchestrator.dispatch_batch(repo, run, units, cap, launch_fn=...)`.
   Each agent self-writes its verdict via `ledger.record_verdict` —
   durable independent of this session.
4. YIELD silently — end the turn. Do NOT ScheduleWakeup.
5. On re-invocation: `orchestrator.converge(repo, run)` reads landed
   verdicts. Predicate met → exit (§5); ready_units → next wave;
   work in flight → yield again.
6. Ticks apply fixes (`verdict-returned → fixed → pending`); re-
   dispatch; re-review. Loop terminates only when every unit reaches
   a clean terminal verdict.

Full mechanism + the "when ScheduleWakeup IS right" long-tail
fallback: `driver-reference.md` §7.

## 5. Exit

Loop exits when tick returns `stop` with `predicate-met` reason and
ledger shows `loop_phase == "done"`. Read `exit_predicate_result.met`
from the ledger; never re-derive. Tick supplies a `report` in its
stop intent; surface it (lists remaining minor findings for operator
promotion). If `exit_reason` is non-null the loop did NOT exit
cleanly — surface kind + error. Full taxonomy:
`driver-reference.md` §8.

## 6. Multi-plan batches (v0.4.0)

A committed sidecar at `<shared-dir>/batches/<id>.json` carries the
composite goal; `lib/on-stop.py` blocks Stop until every sub-run's
predicate is met (provisional sidecars ignored). Mechanism:
`driver-reference.md` §9.

## Invariants

- **Read, never re-derive.** `exit_predicate_result.met` /
  `all_units_terminal` come straight from the ledger.
- **Re-arm only on `action == "rearm"`.** `stop` and `noop` end the
  chain.
- **Driver owns cap; engine owns advance.** Never hardcode
  concurrency; never dispatch from the tick; never write verdicts
  from the driver.
- **Always goaled.** No run proceeds without an active deliberate-stop
  goal/status.
