"""auto U1 (v0.3.0): the ONE iteration-decision module.

Every site that reads a gate step's `decision` field — the pulse's iteration
check, `recompute_predicate`'s iteration_pending computation, `/auto-status`'s
reporting — routes through THIS module. The AST lint
(`tests/unit/iteration-ast-lint.test.sh`) forbids the string literal "decision"
as an `ast.Constant` anywhere in `lib/*.py` EXCEPT this file and `lib/run_record.py`
(the writer in `set_verdict_decision`). A new consumer physically cannot
re-introduce a divergent literal access without tripping the lint.

WHY centralize (memory `feedback_plan_documents_transition_code_doesnt_wire_it`):
the dominant v0.2.0 build-bug class was "a rule the prose describes that the
code enforces in some sites but not its siblings." The iteration `decision`
field is exactly that kind of rule once workflows can declare an `iteration`
block. One helper = one place the decision lives.

WHY the field lives on `dispatch_context` (memory v0.2.0 round-2 P0 fix at
commit `81de3e0` — `set_winner_step_id`): `record_verdict` normalizes findings
to `{severity, note}` only. A `decision` field on findings would be silently
stripped on the canonical write path. `dispatch_context` is preserved by
`transition()` and the verdict-write path with no normalize step. v0.3.0
mirrors the precedent exactly via `set_verdict_decision`.

Loaded via `_bootstrap.load_lib_module("iteration")`.

# the same shape pulse.py uses at line 60. The fence has to hold on the READ
# side (compute_pending_state) too — without it, a kill-switched mid-iteration
# run still computes iteration_pending=True from the gate's stale "iterate"
# verdict, which blocks the predicate's `met` branch via the AND-NOT clause
# and leaves /auto-resume abort as the only escape. F5 unfenced the write
# side (pulse.py:624); G1 mirrors it on the read side so the standard
# predicate-met flow takes over when the operator flips the switch.

# ── Deliberate bound-check duplication (do NOT naively merge) ────────────────
# The iterate-bound comparison (attempts vs max_attempts, active_wall vs
# max_wall) is written twice in this module: `evaluate_decision` (engine
# decision path) and `compute_pending_state` (the recompute path called from
# `_atomic_write` on EVERY write). They are kept separate on purpose because
# both policies are load-bearing and genuinely differ:
#   • Coercion — evaluate_decision uses raw int()/float() that RAISE on a
#     corrupt bound (→ an operator-visible ITERATION_CHECK_FAILED F2 stop);
#     compute_pending_state uses _try_int/_try_float that DEGRADE to False so
#     the recompute never raises and never locks the run-record. A shared
#     never-raise helper would silently convert F2's diagnostic stop into
#     continuation on a torn bound.
#   • Cap applicability — evaluate_decision treats max_attempts == 0 as "no
#     cap" (the `max_attempts > 0` guard); compute_pending_state treats a
#     PRESENT max_attempts (incl. explicit 0) as a real cap. Preserved, not
#     reconciled.
# Merging the comparison would require collapsing these — so the duplication is
# a documented trade, not an open "close the dimension" TODO.


# ── dispatch_context: the typed key set + thin accessors (U12) ───────────────
# `dispatch_context` is the additive per-step bag `transition()` preserves
# verbatim (no normalize step). Historically every consumer read it via
# `(u.get("dispatch_context") or {}).get("<literal>")` — a shape that SWALLOWS a
# typo: `.get("enumarated_steps")` returns None just like a real miss. Declaring
# the key set ONCE + reading through `read_dc` turns a misspelled key into a loud
# KeyError at the accessor instead of a silent None. `read_decision` (the
# centralized decision reader the AST lint pins here) now delegates to `read_dc`,
# so the "decision" literal still lives only in this module.

    Brittleness contract (rel-2): if any of ``iteration_attempts``,

    iteration.py is THE iteration-decision module; the bound check
    ``run_record._compute_iteration_pending`` used to open-code was lifted here so
    the recompute path and the engine path live in one module. The comparison

    short-circuit at ``pulse.advance_iteration_loop`` (lib/pulse.py:624).
    Without this, a kill-switched mid-iteration run can't exit via the
    standard predicate-met path: the gate's stale ``decision="iterate"``
    still composes ``iteration_pending=True`` into the predicate, blocking
    ``met`` via the AND-NOT clause. The operator's only escape would be
    ``/auto-resume abort``. With the parity, flipping the switch lets the
