"""auto U1 (v0.3.0): the ONE iteration-decision module.

Every site that reads a gate unit's `decision` field — the tick's iteration
check, `recompute_predicate`'s iteration_pending computation, `/auto-status`'s
reporting — routes through THIS module. The AST lint
(`tests/unit/iteration-ast-lint.test.sh`) forbids the string literal "decision"
as an `ast.Constant` anywhere in `lib/*.py` EXCEPT this file and `lib/ledger.py`
(the writer in `set_verdict_decision`). A new consumer physically cannot
re-introduce a divergent literal access without tripping the lint.

WHY centralize (memory `feedback_plan_documents_transition_code_doesnt_wire_it`):
the dominant v0.2.0 build-bug class was "a rule the prose describes that the
code enforces in some sites but not its siblings." The iteration `decision`
field is exactly that kind of rule once recipes can declare an `iteration`
block. One helper = one place the decision lives.

WHY the field lives on `dispatch_context` (memory v0.2.0 round-2 P0 fix at
commit `81de3e0` — `set_winner_unit_id`): `record_verdict` normalizes findings
to `{severity, note}` only. A `decision` field on findings would be silently
stripped on the canonical write path. `dispatch_context` is preserved by
`transition()` and the verdict-write path with no normalize step. v0.3.0
mirrors the precedent exactly via `set_verdict_decision`.

Loaded via `_bootstrap.load_lib_module("iteration")`.

# Kill-switch parity with tick.advance_iteration_loop (G1 / rel-r2-1).

# `_lazy_load`) prepends lib/ to sys.path first. Importing the symbol here is
# the same shape tick.py uses at line 60. The fence has to hold on the READ
# side (compute_pending_state) too — without it, a kill-switched mid-iteration
# run still computes iteration_pending=True from the gate's stale "iterate"
# verdict, which blocks the predicate's `met` branch via the AND-NOT clause
# and leaves /auto-resume abort as the only escape. F5 unfenced the write
# side (tick.py:624); G1 mirrors it on the read side so the standard
# predicate-met flow takes over when the operator flips the switch.

# ── Deliberate bound-check duplication (do NOT naively merge) ────────────────
# The iterate-bound comparison (attempts vs max_attempts, active_wall vs
# max_wall) is written twice in this module: `evaluate_decision` (engine
# decision path) and `compute_pending_state` (the recompute path called from
# `_atomic_write` on EVERY write). They are kept separate on purpose because
# both policies are load-bearing and genuinely differ:
#   • Coercion — evaluate_decision uses raw int()/float() that RAISE on a
#     corrupt bound (→ an operator-visible ITERATION_CHECK_FAILED F2 stop);
#     compute_pending_state uses _try_int/_try_float that DEGRADE to False so
#     the recompute never raises and never locks the ledger. A shared
#     never-raise helper would silently convert F2's diagnostic stop into
#     continuation on a torn bound.
#   • Cap applicability — evaluate_decision treats max_attempts == 0 as "no
#     cap" (the `max_attempts > 0` guard); compute_pending_state treats a
#     PRESENT max_attempts (incl. explicit 0) as a real cap. Preserved, not
#     reconciled.
# Merging the comparison would require collapsing these — so the duplication is
# a documented trade, not an open "close the dimension" TODO.

    THE central iteration-bound logic — every caller (the

    tick.advance_iteration_loop) reads the SAME rule through this module.
    Mirrors ``evaluate_decision``'s bound math without surfacing the
    ``decision_effective``/``bound_type`` envelope ``recompute_predicate``
    doesn't need.

    True iff:
        - The run declares an ``iteration`` block.
        - The block names a ``gate_unit`` that exists in ``units[]``.
        - The gate unit's ``dispatch_context.decision == "iterate"``.
        - Neither bound is breached (``iteration_attempts < max_attempts``
          AND ``active_wall_seconds < max_wall_seconds``).

    Brittleness contract (rel-2): if any of ``iteration_attempts``,
    ``active_wall_seconds``, ``max_attempts``, ``max_wall_seconds`` fails
    to coerce to a number, the function returns ``False`` (the ledger's
    numeric state is corrupt and the safest decision is "not pending" —
    treats the in-flight iteration as advisorially-exited so the ledger
    can continue accepting writes). A single corrupt numeric field MUST
    NOT lock out every subsequent ledger mutation, including writes
    needed to recover — this function is called from ``_atomic_write`` on
    EVERY write.

    Why this lives here and not in ``ledger.py``: the AST lint says
    iteration.py is THE iteration-decision module; the bound check
    ``ledger._compute_iteration_pending`` used to open-code was lifted here so
    the recompute path and the engine path live in one module. The comparison
    is still deliberately written twice (here + ``evaluate_decision``) — see the
    module-level "Deliberate bound-check duplication" note for why not to merge.

    Kill-switch parity (G1 / rel-r2-1): when ``CLAUDE_AUTO_DISABLE_ITERATION=1``
    is set, return False unconditionally — symmetric with the write-side
    short-circuit at ``tick.advance_iteration_loop`` (lib/tick.py:624).
    Without this, a kill-switched mid-iteration run can't exit via the
    standard predicate-met path: the gate's stale ``decision="iterate"``
    still composes ``iteration_pending=True`` into the predicate, blocking
    ``met`` via the AND-NOT clause. The operator's only escape would be
    ``/auto-resume abort``. With the parity, flipping the switch lets the
    run exit normally.
