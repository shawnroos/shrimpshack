"""auto B4: the tick's advance + stall-detection logic (split out of lib/tick.py).

These are the functions that perform the ONE smallest-useful advance the tick
owns each beat — the plan-loop step, the work-loop fix/re-enqueue, the
iteration check, and the stall-detect-and-halt that backs the parallel-fan-out
promise — plus the seam transition that routes a finished plan-loop to seam
(manual) or work (auto).

They were extracted VERBATIM from lib/tick.py (B4); no logic changed. The
dependency graph is one-way:

    tick.py        → tick_advance, tick_guidance
    tick_advance   → ledger, iteration, emitters, phase_grammar, tick_guidance
    tick_guidance  → ledger, phase_grammar (leaf)

No cycle: nothing here imports tick.py. `TickError` is defined HERE (raised by
``advance_plan_loop``) and re-exported by tick.py so the single class identity
is shared — ``resolve_adapter`` in tick.py and ``_cli``'s catch both reference
the same class.
