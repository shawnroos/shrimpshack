"""auto: the ONE ledger-module loader.

Every consumer module (tick.py, orchestrator.py, on-stop.py, on-session-start.py,
goal-status.py, auto-resume.py, auto.py, auto-status.py) loads the canonical ledger
module by FILE PATH rather than `import ledger` — the plugin is not pip-installed
and lib/ is not guaranteed on sys.path. That importlib bootstrap used to be
copy-pasted into all eight modules; it lives here ONCE so a change to the load
strategy (or the Python pin contract) has a single edit site.

Usage from a sibling module in lib/::

    import os, sys
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    from _bootstrap import load_ledger
    ledger = load_ledger()

We do NOT load _bootstrap itself via importlib — that would just move the
duplication. The two-line sys.path prepend + plain import is the dedup.

    The ONE load strategy for every lib/ module (the plugin is not pip-installed

    the ``.py`` extension and MAY contain hyphens (e.g. ``"phase-grammar"`` for

    Python module identifier, so the registered spec name sanitizes them to
    underscores (``phase_grammar``). Callers bind the returned module once.

    Added in v0.2.0 (U5) to load the hyphenated ``phase-grammar.py`` (and reusable

    other. The cache mirrors ordinary Python import semantics; the file-path

    own root, NOT the main repo. For multi-plan fanout we need the host repo
    so spawned worktrees nest under the main checkout's ``worktrees/`` —
    independent of which worktree the parent session is itself running in.

    The mechanism uses ``git rev-parse --git-common-dir``: from a main repo

    None case (typically by erroring out: fanout requires a git repo).
