"""auto: the ONE ledger-module loader.

Every consumer module (tick.py, orchestrator.py, on-stop.py, on-session-start.py,
goal-status.py, auto-resume.py, auto.py, auto-status.py) loads the canonical ledger
module by FILE PATH rather than `import ledger` — the plugin is not pip-installed
and lib/ is not guaranteed on sys.path. That importlib bootstrap used to be
copy-pasted into all eight modules; it lives here ONCE so a change to the load
strategy (or the Python pin contract) has a single edit site.

    import os, sys

We do NOT load _bootstrap itself via importlib — that would just move the
duplication. The two-line sys.path prepend + plain import is the dedup.

    ``("plan", "review_plan")`` (native has no deepen step). ``plan_step`` is a
    real validated ledger field (``ledger_core.PLAN_STEPS``) that the tick persists
    via ``set_loop(plan_step=step)``; both adapters read it identically and this
    sequencer keeps the ``None``-tolerance native already relied on. No IO — the
    engine persists the returned step; the adapter never writes the ledger (§1).

    §4.1 coherence guard runs FIRST (livelock hazard): once a ``review_plan``
    round has closed the gaps (``gaps_open == 0``) the next call MUST return
    ``"done"``. It is keyed on ``plan_step in ("review_plan", "done")`` specifically
    because ``gaps_open`` is 0 by default before any review has run — the guard
    must only fire AFTER a real review pass, else the loop would never start.
