"""auto run-record producers: phase-transition + iteration emission/composite paths.

The emission layer of the run-record surface (see lib/run_record.py for the facade and
docs/contracts/run-record-schema.md for the authoritative spec). Holds the shared
emit/validate/append helper (``_emit_steps_core``), the phase-transition primitive
(``transition_and_emit``), the in-phase iteration emit (``emit_within_phase`` +
``_apply_emit``), and the gate-step re-engagement combo (``reset_for_iteration`` +
``_reset_gate_for_iteration`` + ``atomic_iterate_step``).

Sits ABOVE run_record_core in the acyclic DAG (dependency order:
core ← mutators ← producers ← facade). It imports ONLY run_record_core — NOT
run_record_mutators: the composite paths deliberately inline their sub-step bodies
inside ONE outer locked body (the F3 deadlock guard — calling a public mutator
from inside a locked mutate() would re-acquire the flock on a fresh fd and
deadlock), so there is no reason to hold a run_record_mutators handle here, and
holding one would be an attractive nuisance inviting exactly that deadlock.
