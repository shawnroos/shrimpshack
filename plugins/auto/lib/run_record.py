"""auto run-record facade — re-exports the run-record surface from
run_record_core / run_record_mutators / run_record_producers.

This module was split (B5) for maintainability: the implementation now lives in
three sibling modules along an acyclic DAG (core ← mutators ← producers ← this
facade). This file re-exports the WHOLE surface — every public name (the time helpers
``now_iso`` / ``parse_iso`` are public here) PLUS the one private helper
consumers reach through the ``run_record.`` namespace (``_with_locked_run_record``) — so
existing callers that do
``run_record = _bootstrap.load_run_record()`` and reference ``run_record.<name>`` keep
resolving unchanged. See those three modules for the implementation and
docs/contracts/run-record-schema.md for the authoritative spec (if they disagree,
the contract wins and the code is the bug).

  * run_record_core      — constants, errors, paths, time helpers, the atomic-write +
                       flock primitives, and init_run_record / read_run_record.
  * run_record_predicate — the pure predicate logic (recompute_predicate + B7 helpers,
                       gating_severities, step_is_terminal, is_orphaned); imports
                       only run_record_core, reached from core's _atomic_write via a
                       deferred lazy-load (U16).
  * run_record_mutators  — the grammar-checked, flock-serialized scalar mutators
                       (transition, record_verdict, set_loop, set_gaps_open,
                       set_*, accumulate_active_time, increment_iteration_attempts).
  * run_record_steering  — the AGENT-facing steering verbs (force_skip, add_step,
                       reshape_deps, register_session). Imports mutators for two
                       graph helpers; never the reverse.
  * run_record_producers  — phase-transition + iteration emission/composite paths
                       (transition_and_emit, emit_within_phase, reset_for_iteration,
                       atomic_iterate_step, and their pure helpers).

The CLI (``_cli`` + ``__main__`` block) stays here so lib/run_record.sh can keep
routing through ``run_record.py``.

    cleared ONLY by a clean `auto-resume continue` (forgiveness). That stickiness
    is the anti-self-disarm door — an agent that hits the backstop cannot run
    `auto-resume pause` to drop the latch and retry the destructive command
    (advisor-gate P3-b). So we pass backstop_latched to set_loop only when
    latching; omitting it leaves set_loop's field unchanged (UNSET sentinel).

# ─── the OPERATOR revert command (U10 / KTD-1) ──────────────────────────────
# `downgrade` is deliberately NOT a `_VERBS` entry. That registry is the AGENT tool
# surface: `describe` publishes it, docs/contracts/agent-tool-surface.md fences it,
# and a driving agent is told to orient by it. An offline, data-destructive, revert-
# only operator action has no business in the set an agent is told it may call — so
# it is dispatched here, ahead of the registry, and `describe`/`_VERBS` are untouched.
# (Same division as `workflows.py migrate`: the maintenance command lives beside the
# format it maintains, not on the agent's surface.)
#
# It lives on THIS module — not on lib/format_compat.py, which owns the maps — for one
# hard reason: format_compat is a DAG ROOT that imports no sibling, so it cannot reach
# the run-record flock, and KTD-1 requires the downgrade to write UNDER THAT LOCK
# ("the same lock every mutation holds, so it never races a concurrent in-process
# write"). This module already loads run_record_core, so the real lock is one call away.
#
# It CANNOT go through core's normal read/write helpers, and that is not an oversight:
#   * `_read_json` UPGRADES on read (chokepoint 1) — it would hand back a v2 dict.
#   * `_atomic_write` re-stamps `format: 2` and recomputes the predicate — it would
#     undo the downgrade in the same breath.
# The whole point of a downgrade is to bypass the shim, so this does a RAW read and a
# RAW atomic write, and borrows ONLY the lock.

    same directory, same stem — and tests/unit/format-compat.test.sh PINS that
    equivalence against the real helpers, so a change to the lock convention in core
    turns this red instead of silently unlocking the downgrade.

    OFFLINE / QUIESCED ONLY. The flock stops a CONCURRENT writer from being lost; it

# KTD-4 REVISITED — the retired work-node verbs get DEPRECATED ALIASES.
#
# U7 hard-cut `add-unit` / `set-enumerated-units` to their `step` spelling with NO
# alias, on the reasoning that "verbs are never persisted, so nothing in flight can
# hold one". That reasoning is wrong, and it is the ONE place the rename decided this
# question inconsistently:
#
#   The pre-rename guidance module (what is now `lib/pulse_guidance.py`) EMITS
#   GUIDANCE naming these verbs — it hands the driving agent a literal
#   `… set-enumerated-units <args>` line to run. The verb is not persisted, but the
#   INSTRUCTION TO RUN IT is: it sits in an agent's context (and in a persisted rearm
#   prompt) across the upgrade. An agent mid-run then executes a verb that exits 2 and
#   the run stalls — the exact in-flight scenario the deprecated flag aliases and the
#   kept alias command exist for. Same problem; it was decided the other way here.
#
# Same mechanism as `_DEPRECATED_FLAGS` in lib/auto.py: rewrite the retired spelling
# to its canonical one, emit exactly ONE stderr notice (stdout stays byte-clean, so
# `… read | jq` keeps working), and fall through to the canonical handler — which owns
# arity and validation. There is no second implementation to drift.
#
# NOT in `_VERBS`, and so NOT in `describe` or the agent-tool-surface contract: an
# alias is a bridge for an agent that already holds the old name, not a verb we
# advertise. Same posture as `downgrade`. Removed in v0.15.0 (docs/deprecations.md).
