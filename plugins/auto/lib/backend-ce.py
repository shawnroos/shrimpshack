"""auto U6b: the Compound Engineering (CE) backend — Python surface.

This is the module pulse.py (U4) imports. `resolve_backend` (pulse.py:170-197)
loads `lib/backend-ce.py`, prefers a module-level ``Backend`` factory if present,
and calls the six ops on it: ``next_plan_step(run-record) / plan(run-record) /
deepen(run-record) / review_plan(run-record) / do_step(step) / review(step)``.

The pure, contract-load-bearing logic (severity mapping + the plan-step state
machine) is implemented HERE in Python so pulse.py can import it directly. The
bash sibling ``backend-ce.sh`` exposes the same logic as a CLI for direct
testing / scripting; the two are intentional mirrors.

A backend is a PURE PROVIDER OF OPERATIONS — it NEVER writes the run-record
(contract §1). Ops return data; the engine persists it through run_record.py.

PLAN-STEP STATE: `next_plan_step` reads `run_record["plan_step"]` (the plan-phase
sub-state, schema §3.1) to compute the next step. The pulse persists the executed
step via `set_loop(plan_step=step)` after each plan-loop advance
(pulse_advance.py), so a fresh-process pulse reads the real sub-state — the loop
advances plan → deepen → review_plan → done and does not livelock. (Historical
note: an earlier U6b/U3 handoff had no schema field for this; the gap was closed
when `plan_step` became a validated field — see run_record_core.py's PLAN_STEPS.)

DECLARED SEVERITY MAPPING (contract §3.1, fixed property):
    P0 -> blocker;  P1 -> major;  P2 -> major;  P3 -> minor
DECLARED backend_scale: "three-tier"
    CE's /ce-code-review emits stable P0/P1/P2/P3 that map cleanly onto all
    three shared severities, so CE skips the rubric probe (SKILL.md §"command-
    driven reviewer") and declares three-tier directly.
