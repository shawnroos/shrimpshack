"""auto U6: loop/recipe → execution tree with sized parallelism (KTD6 / KTD6b).

`derive_execution_tree(recipe, cap)` turns a validated recipe dict (from
`auto-author-recipe` / `auto-design`) into an EXECUTION TREE: ordered parallel
waves derived from the `depends_on` DAG, fan-out `do_unit` children nested under
their emitter parent, and a substrate ROUTING DECISION. It is PURE and
deterministic — it plans a topology, it never dispatches (`skills/auto-translate`
wraps it; `lib/orchestrator.py::dispatch_batch` is the executor).

Four steps (mirroring KTD6 / KTD6b):

  1. EXPAND emitter-produced units. Recipes like `recipes/a4.json` declare their
     paired builders in `expected_emit_outputs` (materialized at RUN time by a
     phase-boundary emitter), NOT in `units[]`. `orchestrator._is_ready` treats an
     absent dependency as unsatisfied, so a raw frontier walk over a4 yields only
     `{plan}` and `compare` is never ready. We synthesize placeholder nodes for
     those declared ids FIRST so the dependents can become ready.
     `recipes/a2.json`'s parallel units are STATIC (already in `units[]`) — no
     expansion.

  2. FRONTIER WALK the (expanded) DAG, reusing the readiness logic in
     `lib/orchestrator.py` (`_is_ready` / `_dependency_satisfied`). We drive that
     exact predicate over an in-memory unit list: place every ready unit, then
     flip it `pending → verdict-returned` (a satisfied dependency in the
     contract's precise sense) so the next frontier unblocks its dependents. Each
     frontier is one WAVE — units in a wave are parallel — bounded to `cap`; the
     over-cap remainder stays pending and spills to the next wave, mirroring
     `dispatch_batch`'s over-cap behavior.

  3. NEST fan-out `do_unit` children under their emitter parent (the unit whose
     completion triggers their emission — the phase-boundary emitter's source).

  4. SUBSTRATE SELECTION (a routing decision — never execution). A self-contained
     bounded parallel-fan-in loop (single-phase, no per-unit ce-work/review
     adapter dispatch, an engine-enforced bound) routes to `"workflow-script"` —
     an INERT routing label plus a topology preview, NOT a runnable compiled
     script (the parked RFC's `pipeline()`/`parallel()` compiler is unbuilt,
     KTD6b). Everything else routes to `"subagent-tree"`, the default and the ONLY
     executable target this run (`dispatch_batch`). Both routings are supervised
     from OUTSIDE either way (U1's wedge-timeout lives external to the substrate),
     so the label changes the compile target, never the supervision.

Returns a structured dict — see `derive_execution_tree`.
