"""auto ledger mutators: grammar-checked, flock-serialized write paths.

The mutation layer of the ledger surface (see lib/ledger.py for the facade and

routes through ``ledger_core._with_locked_ledger`` (the one RMW primitive), which

``set_verdict_decision``, ``set_bound_override``, ``set_driving_session_id``,
``append_advisor_audit``, ``set_exit_reason``, ``accumulate_active_time``,
``increment_iteration_attempts``.

    ``dispatch_context.enumerated_units`` (v0.2.0 U6, the producer-persist).

    Called at plan-done with the adapter's enumerated work-unit list. The
    phase-transition emitter (U5b) reads it from here when emitting work units —
    so this is the on-ledger bridge between "the plan finished" and "here are its
    work units," resolving F4 (v0.1.x had no in-code producer). ``enumerated`` is
    a list of partial unit dicts (each at least an ``id``). Raises if the named
    unit doesn't exist. Atomic (predicate recompute is a no-op here — the plan
    unit's own state is unchanged — but the write stays on the I-1 path).

    depends_on GUARD (U14 P2 anti-livelock): each item's model-emitted
    ``depends_on`` is sanitized here — the single chokepoint where runtime model
    output enters the ledger. An edge that names no known id (dangling), a unit's
    own id (self), or that participates in a cycle would leave the materialized
    work unit permanently un-``_is_ready`` (``dep is None -> False``, or a
    mutually-unsatisfiable cycle): never ready, never dispatched, dispatch-timeout
    never fires, ``all_units_terminal`` false FOREVER → a silent full-run
    livelock. The recipe-authored path already rejects unknown-id references at
    author time (``recipes._validate_depends_on``).

    DROP, don't raise (deliberate divergence from ``set_winner_unit_id``, which
    raises on a bad single reference): this validates a whole BATCH of runtime
    model output, and a raise would abort the persist → the plan phase
    materializes ZERO work units → also a stall. So invalid edges are dropped and
    recorded on ``dispatch_context.dropped_depends_on_edges`` (a durable, testable
    forensic marker) plus a one-line stderr warning, and the run continues.
    Valid edges — including forward-refs to sibling enumerated units — are
    preserved verbatim (behavior-preserving happy path).
