"""auto U7: deterministic loop-status, the data behind goal-status.sh.

Consumer: the engine's OWN Stop hook (.claude/hooks/on-stop.sh). NOT native
`/goal` (U9 spike: `/goal` is a closed model-judged loop with no external
predicate seam — see docs/research/native-goal-mechanism-spike.md).

FRESHNESS GUARANTEE (C2 / I-1):
    No cached copy exists; we read the I-1-fresh field directly off the ledger.
    `exit_predicate_result` is recomputed inside ledger.py's single atomic-write
    chokepoint on every write (schema §5 I-1). Here we ONLY read it back — we do
    NOT maintain a separate `done` that could drift. `done` IS
    `exit_predicate_result.met` from the same atomic snapshot. There is no
    staleness window where status says done while the ledger says not (the
    re-review verdict-returned → pending reopen is reflected immediately because
    the predicate is recomputed on that very write).

Reads the ledger LOCK-FREE: the atomic-rename invariant (mkstemp + os.rename)
means a reader always sees a whole, consistent file — never a torn one. This
keeps the Stop hook trivially under any hook timeout (no flock contention with a
slow writer).

Output: one JSON object on stdout —
    {"active": bool, "done": bool, "reason": str, "iterations": int}

A missing or malformed ledger yields active:false (allow stop) and exit 0
(rel-001 — never break the harness).
