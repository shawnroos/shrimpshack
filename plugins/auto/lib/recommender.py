"""auto v0.6.0 U2: the ce-family recommender (PURE deterministic mapping).

Bare `/auto` after a rich conversation routes through the `conversation-context`
situation (lib/auto-detect.sh, U1). The DRIVER (skills/auto-driver) reflects on
its own live transcript + a ~2-day ce-sessions lookback, classifies the session
into ONE state label, and asks THIS module which ce-family step to run.

This module is a PURE function of (state_label, confidence). It does NOT read the
transcript, the ledger, or the filesystem — the driver supplies the classified
state and a confidence score; the module returns the deterministic recommendation
tuple. Keeping the mapping here (not in skill prose) makes the routing taxonomy
deterministic, testable, and grep-checkable — `feedback_deterministic_over_
probabilistic_v1`. The fuzzy step (classify the conversation) stays in the model;
the crisp step (state -> recommendation) is code.

TAXONOMY (plan KTD-2; v0.6.0):

  state label            ce step        recipe_or_entry    entry      spine?  kind
  ---------------------- -------------- ------------------ ---------- ------- ------
  vague                  ce-brainstorm  pipeline           brainstorm spine   recipe
  clear-intent-no-plan   ce-plan        a1                 plan       spine   recipe
  reviewed-plan          work-only      w                  work       spine   recipe
  code-unreviewed        ce-code-review review (review.json) work       off     recipe
  bug                    ce-debug       /ce-debug          -          off     skill
  what-to-improve        ce-ideate      /ce-ideate         -          n/a     skill
  perf                   ce-optimize    /ce-optimize       -          off     skill

WHY vague dispatches the spine recipe `pipeline` (not a `/ce-brainstorm` skill
rec): the brainstorm-rooted spine (recipes/pipeline.json, U7/U8) ships in THIS
v0.6.0 diff alongside the recommender — Phase A (entry) and Phase B (forward
spine) land together. So vague routes to a real `pipeline` dispatch entering at
the `brainstorm` phase, and the run auto-advances brainstorm→plan→work (the
plan's headline success criterion: "A spine run auto-advances
brainstorm→plan→work" through the smart-entry route). `recipe_or_entry` is the
bare recipe STEM ("pipeline"), not the filename — auto.py resolves it via
`recipes.load_and_validate(name, repo)` → f"{name}.json" (same as a1/w/review).

WHY debug/optimize are SKILL recs (not recipes): the CE adapter exposes only
plan/deepen/review_plan/enumerate_plan_units/do_unit/review (lib/adapter-ce.py),
so a `debug.json`/`optimize.json` recipe would be a non-functional stub. Only
`review.json` (the `review` op exists) is a real off-spine recipe. debug/optimize
follow the `ce-ideate` precedent — recommend the skill, no auto-wrap.

CONFIDENCE / ESCALATE: confidence is an INPUT (the driver's own certainty in its
classification), not something this module computes. Below CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD,
`escalate` is True regardless of state — the driver then escalates to the operator
BEFORE dispatch (U3) rather than acting on a shaky classification (R-5). An
UNKNOWN state ALSO escalates (the safe default) and never crashes.

Size budget (R-6): this module stays well under the 1000-LOC file / 120-LOC
function lints. Loaded via `_bootstrap.load_lib_module("recommender")`.
