"""auto U4: decision logic behind .claude/hooks/on-pretooluse-action.sh.

The deterministic destructive-action backstop (KTD-4/5). On a Bash tool call,
under the SAME live-run + session_id ownership gate as the question hook, match
the `command` against the CLAUDE.md-anchored irreversible/destructive set and
ESCALATE via the pause seam. Write tool calls reach this hook (the plugin
matches both) but only their `command` field is classified — which Write never
sets — so Write is effectively a no-op here (round-4 P2: Write `content` is NOT
scanned; see ``_command_text``).

FAILS CLOSED (KTD-4 — the opposite asymmetry from the question gate):
    on a CONFIRMED destructive command for a CONFIRMED live run, this hook PAUSES
    the run (set_loop driver="manual" + blocked_on) UNCONDITIONALLY — even when
    the PreToolUse `deny` contract is unavailable. It never degrades to
    silent-allow on a destructive match. The halt is observable on the LEDGER
    (driver=manual / blocked_on), not the process exit code (which stays 0).

    Scope of fail-closed is PRECISE: a confirmed-destructive command on a
    confirmed-live owned run. A malformed ledger, an unidentifiable run, a
    non-owned session, or a BENIGN command all fall through to allow (matching
    the question hook's malformed->allow scenario). We do NOT blanket-deny on any
    exception — that would brick the tool flow on an unrelated read.

DENY-CONTRACT MODES:
    * normal (deny supported): emit the deny JSON (blocks the single call) AND
      pause the run (halts the loop). Belt-and-suspenders.
    * deny-unsupported (test hatch CLAUDE_AUTO_TEST_DENY_UNSUPPORTED, fenced via
      test_hatch_enabled): still pause the run, but emit a `systemMessage`
      instead of the deny payload — never an empty/allow output on a destructive
      match. This is the fail-closed path the integration test exercises.

BYPASS RESIDUALS (KTD-4 — documented out-of-scope, NOT covered by this
classifier): the general flag-reorder/long-form class (`rm -vrf`,
`rm --recursive --force` — we catch the literal `rm -rf` and `rm -fr` only),
refspec force-push (`git push origin +<ref>`), compound commands (`a; rm -rf b`),
and eval/obfuscation. ALSO out-of-scope (fix-round-5 P2): GitHub MCP write tools
(`delete_file`, `merge_pull_request`, `push_files`, `create_or_update_file`) — they
do NOT flow through the Bash `command` channel this classifier reads (their
tool_input carries no `command`), and the hook is wired to Bash/Write tool names
only, so an MCP tool name never reaches it. Gating MCP-write tools is a tool-name
interception change beyond v0.6.0's detect-and-escalate scope; fan-out units carry
the prompt-embedded two-seam instruction instead. The classifier is a
deterministic minimum-set backstop, not a comprehensive sandbox.

PATH-SCOPING (drive-friction fix — narrows the rm family ONLY): the `rm -rf`/
`rm -fr` matches are exempted when EVERY path target provably resolves to a real
child under a known-ephemeral root (/tmp / /private/tmp / /var/folders) — see
``_rm_targets_all_ephemeral``. Benign teardown of fan-out agents' scratch dirs
and the operator's finalize cleanup was false-firing the fail-closed backstop
and LATCHING the run. Exemption (unlike gating) is CONSERVATIVE about runtime
expansion: a target with a glob / command-substitution / brace / unresolved
`$`-var gates, the temp ROOT itself gates, `..` traversal gates, and `$TMPDIR` is
RESOLVED from the hook env (unset/empty -> gate, so `rm -rf "$TMPDIR/"` can't
expand to `rm -rf /`). This is an allowlist that only narrows in-scope rm
matches; it does NOT widen the residual set above and does NOT touch the
git/gh/npm patterns.

    Base match: ``current phase != "done" AND session_id == driving_session_id``
    — DELIBERATELY OMITTING the ``last_beat_at`` staleness conjunct the question
    gate keeps, and NOT requiring ``driver == "self"`` (with ONE precise
    operator-pause exemption, below). Both choices exist because this hook fails
    CLOSED and a denied tool call does NOT end the agent's turn:

      * driver: THIS hook's own ``_pause_run`` flips the owned run to
        ``driver="manual"`` the instant it blocks the first destructive command.
        A plain ``driver=="self"`` requirement would make every SUBSEQUENT
        destructive command see ``driver=="manual"`` → no match → ALLOW
        (self-disarm after one fire). So we do NOT key on ``driver=="self"``.
      * staleness (round-2 P2 fix): ``_pause_run`` calls ``set_loop`` WITHOUT
        ``beat=True``, so it does NOT re-stamp ``last_beat_at``. If the operator
        deliberates past ``DRIVER_SELF_STALE_SECONDS`` (3900s) after the backstop
        fires once, a stale-conjunct would read the paused run as a dead chain →
        no match → ALLOW a second ``rm -rf`` / force-push — the exact self-disarm
        the driver omission was meant to prevent, reintroduced through the
        staleness door. A live session whose id equals the recorded driving id IS
        the run to gate regardless of beat freshness; pausing a genuinely-dead run
        is harmless (fail-safe). So staleness lives ONLY in the question hook
        (where stale→allow is a benign fail-OPEN), never here.

    OPERATOR-PAUSE EXEMPTION (P3-b): a run the OPERATOR manually paused
    (``driver=="manual"`` WITHOUT ``loop.backstop_latched``) is under human
    control — the autonomous tick loop is dormant, so the only actor issuing tool
    calls is the operator, and we must NOT gate their own cleanup (``rm`` etc.).
    The ONE ``driver=="manual"`` state we KEEP gating is a pause THIS backstop
    caused: ``_pause_run`` sets ``backstop_latched=True`` atomically with the
    pause, so a second destructive command in the same autonomous turn still
    matches (no self-disarm). The latch is STICKY across an agent-run
    ``auto-resume pause`` (that path does not clear it), so once the backstop has
    FIRED a self-driven agent cannot re-disarm it — only an operator
    ``continue``/``abort`` clears it (continue clears the latch; abort ends the
    run). Trade-off (documented, surfaced to the operator in the deny reason): a
    run that ALREADY tripped the backstop keeps blocking the operator's own
    destructive commands during a *pause* — they must ``continue`` or ``abort``
    first; ``abort`` → ``phase=done`` is the clean full-release cleanup path.

    KNOWN RESIDUAL — pre-latch self-disarm (adversarial review, v0.13.0;
    PRE-EXISTING, not introduced by U8). The stickiness above closes the
    POST-fire retry, not the FIRST destructive command. A self-driven agent that
    has not yet tripped the backstop can run a benign ``auto-resume pause`` (which
    calls ``apply_pause`` with the default ``backstop_latched=False``) and then a
    destructive command in the same turn — the exemption fires because
    ``driver=="manual"`` and the latch is unset. A clean fix requires
    distinguishing an AGENT-initiated pause from an OPERATOR-initiated one, but at
    the CLI both run in the driving session with the same ``session_id`` and both
    set ``driver=="manual"`` — they are not distinguishable without a new,
    agent-honest signal (and a prompt-injected agent would just omit it). U6's
    boss hand-back also legitimately calls ``auto-resume pause``, so latching on
    EVERY pause would gate the operator's own post-hand-back cleanup — a real UX
    regression. Left as a documented residual rather than a half-fix; the backstop
    is defense-in-depth against a MISBEHAVING agent (an agent with Bash edits the
    ledger directly regardless), not a sandbox against a MALICIOUS one.

    Dimension #2 (a concurrent STANDALONE ce-skill is not gated) is preserved by
    the ``session_id`` MEMBERSHIP conjunct alone — a standalone skill is neither
    the driving session nor a registered sub-agent, so it never matches. Still
    NOT on-stop's `_is_blocking` (no met-state coupling).

    OWNERSHIP IS A SET (U8 / R21 / KTD-7): the loop's phase work — including
    ``fix``, which writes code and runs Bash — now runs in background sub-agents
    that carry their OWN session_id. Matching only the scalar ``driving_session_id``
    left the destructive backstop dark for exactly the phase most likely to run a
    destructive command. A dispatched sub-agent registers itself into
    ``agent_session_ids`` and is gated identically to the boss.

    THE OPERATOR-PAUSE EXEMPTION IS DRIVING-SESSION-ONLY (the hazard U8 had to
    avoid): the exemption above exists because, during a pause the human
    initiated, the only actor issuing tool calls is the OPERATOR doing their own
    cleanup. A sub-agent is NEVER the operator — an in-flight sub-agent can still
    be executing while the operator deliberates. Extending the exemption to the
    whole owner set would have let a registered sub-agent run ``rm -rf`` during an
    operator pause: a strictly WIDER destructive surface than before U8, created
    by the very change meant to narrow it. So the exemption is gated on
    ``is_driving``. tests/integration/tree-ownership.test.sh scenario 5 is the
    regression.
