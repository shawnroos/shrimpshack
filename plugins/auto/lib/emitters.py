"""auto U5b (v0.2.0): the phase-transition emitter registry (G1).

Recipes declare WHAT topology to run; emitters are HOW work units come into being
at a phase boundary. v0.1.x produced work units off-ledger (the seam paused for
manual creation); v0.2.0 makes emission a first-class, in-engine step so A2/A4
actually spawn their units.

THE PRODUCER (the F4 gap that almost shipped): emitters do NOT invent plan output
— they read it from `unit["dispatch_context"]["enumerated_units"]`, which the
engine persists when a plan unit reaches `plan-done` by calling the adapter's
`enumerate_plan_units` op (U6 wires the persist; the adapter op is the v0.2.0
contract re-lock). So the data flow is: plan-loop runs → adapter enumerates the
plan's work units → engine stashes them on the plan unit → emitter reads + shapes
them into ledger units at the phase boundary.

EMITTERS ARE PURE (F3): each is `(ledger, to_phase) -> list[new_unit_dict]`. They
READ the ledger dict and RETURN new partial unit dicts. They MUST NOT call ledger
mutators — `ledger.transition_and_emit` calls them INSIDE its locked write, and a
re-entrant mutator would deadlock on the flock. The primitive appends + normalizes
what they return.

V1 ships exactly 3 emitters (A3's `review_findings_to_plan_input` deferred with A3,
KTD-14). The NAME registry below is what `recipes.V1_EMITTER_NAMES` mirrors; a
test asserts the two sets match so a recipe can't name an emitter that isn't here.
