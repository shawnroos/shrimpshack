"""auto U5b (v0.2.0): the phase-transition emitter registry (G1).

Recipes declare WHAT topology to run; emitters are HOW work units come into being
at a phase boundary. v0.1.x produced work units off-ledger (the seam paused for
manual creation); v0.2.0 makes emission a first-class, in-engine step so A2/A4
actually spawn their units.

THE PRODUCER (the F4 gap that almost shipped): emitters do NOT invent plan output
— they read it from `unit["dispatch_context"]["enumerated_units"]`, which the
engine persists when a plan unit reaches `plan-done` by calling the adapter's
`enumerate_plan_units` op (U6 wires the persist; the adapter op is the v0.2.0
contract re-lock). So the data flow is: plan-loop runs → adapter enumerates the
plan's work units → engine stashes them on the plan unit → emitter reads + shapes
them into ledger units at the phase boundary.

EMITTERS ARE PURE (F3): each is `(ledger, to_phase) -> list[new_unit_dict]`. They
READ the ledger dict and RETURN new partial unit dicts. They MUST NOT call ledger
mutators — `ledger.transition_and_emit` calls them INSIDE its locked write, and a
re-entrant mutator would deadlock on the flock. The primitive appends + normalizes
what they return.

V1 ships exactly 3 emitters (A3's `review_findings_to_plan_input` deferred with A3,
KTD-14). The NAME registry below is what `recipes.V1_EMITTER_NAMES` mirrors; a
test asserts the two sets match so a recipe can't name an emitter that isn't here.

    Materializes ``emit_count`` new units off the recipe's named template at

    ``iterate`` with a payload, the engine calls this emitter through
    ``emit_within_phase``, new sibling units land inside the gate's current
    phase, and the gate unit resets to pending with extended ``depends_on``.

    The id contract is monotonic — the Nth unit emitted across the WHOLE run
    gets id ``id_prefix + (counter+N)`` where ``counter`` is the pre-emit
    ``ledger["iteration_emit_count"]``. The emitter NEVER recounts existing
    units (round-3 P0-R3-2): after a partial-emit crash the counter may
    exceed the surviving unit count, and recount-based id assignment would
    re-use ids that previously existed and got lost. The counter only ever
    advances; ``_apply_emit`` (lib/ledger.py) bumps it under the flock once
    PER emitted unit, after this function returns.

    Reads (pure, no ledger mutation):
      - ``ledger.iteration.gate_unit`` → gate unit id (required; the U5
        validator enforces this on the recipe, but defense-in-depth: a
        freshly-mutated ledger missing this field is a recipe-shape error).
      - ``ledger.iteration.emit_template`` → template name.
      - ``ledger.emit_templates[<name>]`` → ``{phase, invokes, id_prefix}``.
      - Gate unit's ``dispatch_context.decision_payload.emit_count`` → N
        (default 1). Must be int (booleans rejected — ``isinstance(True, int)``
        is True in Python, and a True payload masquerading as 1 is a
        misshapen payload, not a valid emit_count). 1 ≤ emit_count ≤ 10
        (round-3 P1-R3-4: upper bound prevents a misbehaving gate agent from
        DOS-emitting 1000 units in one tick).
      - ``ledger.iteration_emit_count`` (default 0 on v0.2.x-shape ledgers)
        → the monotonic id base.

    Emits N partial unit dicts. Each carries ``phase`` + ``invokes`` from
    the template, an explicit id (so ``_apply_emit``'s setdefault doesn't
    override), an empty ``depends_on`` (the gate unit's depends_on is
    extended by ``reset_for_iteration``, not the new units'), and an empty
    ``dispatch_context`` (the gate's payload is per-iteration; the new
    units are blanks for the next round of plan-work).
