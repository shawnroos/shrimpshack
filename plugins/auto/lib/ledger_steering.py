"""auto ledger steering: the AGENT-FACING write verbs (R3/R5/R20/R21).

The steering layer of the ledger surface. Where ``ledger_mutators`` holds the
engine's own scalar mutators, this module holds the verbs a DRIVING AGENT calls to
reshape a live run: retire an obsolete unit, add newly-discovered work, re-wire a
dependency, and join the ownership set that the PreToolUse hooks gate on.

Extracted from ``ledger_mutators`` when that file crossed the 1000-LOC budget. The
split is conceptual, not merely mechanical: these four verbs are the surface the
agent-native runtime exposes as tools, and they share one contract —

    read freely; write only through a verb that revalidates its precondition
    INSIDE the flock and can REJECT.

Every verb here wraps precondition + mutate + predicate-recompute in a single
``ledger_core._with_locked_ledger`` call (I-1 / KTD-2). The model never holds the
lock and never does a read-then-write across two invocations, so a slow agent
deciding against a stale snapshot has its write rejected rather than merged.
``tests/unit/steering-verbs.test.sh`` asserts that structurally, per verb, via AST.

Sits ABOVE ledger_mutators in the acyclic DAG
(core ← mutators ← steering ← facade): imports ledger_core for the lock primitive
and errors, and ledger_mutators for the two graph helpers ``add_unit`` /
``reshape_deps`` reuse (``_sanitize_enumerated_depends_on``,
``_find_depends_on_back_edge``) rather than hand-rolling a second sanitizer or
cycle detector. Imports NOTHING from emitters or the facade.

    The steering verb behind R3/R20, and the ONLY producer of the
    `pending -> terminal-skip` / `verdict-returned -> terminal-skip` edges. An
    agent that judges a unit obsolete no longer has to contrive a dispatch
    timeout to retire it.

    ``reason`` is REQUIRED and must be non-blank (R20) — a skip is auditable,
    never silent. It is stored on the unit as ``skip_reason`` and rendered by
    /auto-status. A blank/absent reason raises LedgerError and writes nothing.
    Because the edges live in ``_FORCE_SKIP_SOURCE_STATES`` rather than
    ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS, the reason cannot be bypassed by calling `transition()`.

    I-1 (KTD-2): the precondition check, the mutation, and the predicate

    deciding against a stale snapshot has its write REJECTED rather than merged.
    This function performs no ledger read or write outside that closure; the
    steering-verbs test asserts that structurally.

    Does NOT bury findings: a skipped unit keeps its ``findings``, and
    ``_count_severities_by_unit`` counts them regardless of state, so a blocker on
    a force-skipped unit still holds ``met`` false (AE5). A never-dispatched unit
    carries no findings, so skipping it CAN clear the predicate — deliberate;
    the done-floor is "no open gating findings" (R16), not "all work performed."

    The steering verb behind R3 (an agent that discovers the plan needs one more
    unit of work adds it directly, instead of re-running the plan phase). The new
    unit is built through ``ledger_core._normalize_unit`` — it enters the ledger
    with the SAME shape as an init-time or enumerate-time unit (state defaults to
    ``pending``, the full findings/depends_on/attempt/skip_reason/… key set
    present), so no downstream reader has to special-case an agent-added unit. We
    do NOT hand-assemble the unit dict; the one unit-builder is the SSOT for shape.

    I-1 (KTD-2): the duplicate-id check, the depends_on sanitize, the normalize
    and the append all run inside ONE ``_with_locked_ledger`` call, and the
    predicate is recomputed in that same atomic snapshot. A slow agent adding a
    unit against a stale view has its write REVALIDATED and REJECTED rather than
    merged; this function performs no ledger read or write outside that closure
    (the steering-verbs lock-discipline test asserts this structurally).

    Two invariants, both enforced INSIDE the lock because either violation would
    otherwise wedge the run:
      * DUPLICATE id → rejected. Two units sharing an id make ``_find_unit``
        ambiguous (it returns the first match) and every id-keyed write becomes
        nondeterministic — that is corruption, not a recoverable stall, so we
        raise and write nothing.
      * a ``depends_on`` edge to an UNKNOWN unit → rejected. Unlike
        ``set_enumerated_units`` (which DROPS bad edges because it validates a
        whole BATCH of model output, where a raise would materialize zero work
        units — itself a stall), ``add_unit`` is a single DELIBERATE add: a bad
        edge is a caller mistake we surface loudly, not silently repair. A
        dangling edge would leave the unit permanently un-``_is_ready``
        (``dep is None -> False``) — the exact silent-livelock class the
        enumerate sanitizer exists to catch — so we REUSE that sanitizer
        (``_sanitize_enumerated_depends_on``) rather than duplicate its logic and
        turn any dropped edge into a hard reject. A self-edge is reported by the
        sanitizer as ``self`` and likewise rejected (a unit depending on itself
        is never ready).

    New units are always ``pending`` — the ONLY legal birth state (every other
    state is reached along the §3 grammar). ``depends_on`` defaults to empty;
    ``phase`` defaults to ``_normalize_unit``'s run-phase-derived default
    (``"work"`` outside a plan phase).

    Two rejections, both guarding readiness liveness:

        ``set_enumerated_units`` sanitizes away, but a deliberate single reshape

        silent full-run livelock. The check runs the SHARED detector
        (``_find_depends_on_back_edge``) over the WHOLE unit graph with THIS

        cycle THROUGH OTHER units (e.g. A->B already exists; reshaping B->A
        closes it), the batch-internal-only view ``set_enumerated_units`` uses is
        insufficient here, so we widen the graph but reuse the detector verbatim

    A dispatched phase sub-agent calls this on start. Both PreToolUse hooks then
    gate it by membership of ``{driving_session_id} ∪ agent_session_ids`` instead
    of scalar equality against the boss's session — which is why the fail-closed
    destructive backstop now fires inside the sub-agent tree, where the ``fix``
    phase writes code and runs Bash.

    Membership is opt-IN by registration, never by co-location: an unrelated
    Claude session running in the same worktree is in neither key and is never
    gated (the "standalone ce-skill is not captured" dimension is preserved).

    Idempotent — re-registering an already-present id is a no-op, so a sub-agent
    that retries its own start does not grow the set. Bounded at
    ``_MAX_AGENT_SESSIONS`` so a pathological re-dispatch loop cannot grow the
    ledger without limit; the oldest entry is evicted first.

    EVICTION IS A FIFO HEURISTIC, NOT A LIVENESS GUARANTEE (adversarial/security
    review, v0.13.0). The oldest-registered id is the one MOST LIKELY already
    complete, so FIFO is a reasonable proxy for "drop the dead one" — but it is a
    proxy. A sub-agent registers ONCE at start (not per command), so a still-live
    early agent that is evicted after ``_MAX_AGENT_SESSIONS`` later distinct
    registrations falls out of the set and the destructive backstop goes dark for
    it, reverting to the prompt-carried constraints (§4.6) as the only guard. The
    cap is set well above a realistic run's session count (fan-out cap 16 per
    wave, idempotent retries don't grow the set), so eviction should never fire in
    a normal run; if it does, that run is anomalous. This is defense-in-depth
    against a MISBEHAVING agent, not a sandbox against a MALICIOUS one — an agent
    with Bash can edit the ledger JSON directly regardless.

    I-1: read + membership check + append happen inside ONE
    ``_with_locked_ledger`` call. Two sub-agents registering concurrently
    serialize; neither loses the other's id.

    CALLER-TRUST: the CLI verb accepts an arbitrary ``session_id`` arg, so it is
    the CALLER's responsibility to pass its OWN id — the §4.8 dispatch contract
    has each sub-agent register ``$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`` (its own env id), so a
    sub-agent only ever adds ITSELF. A process that passes a third party's id
    could gate that bystander (a DoS, not a destructive-command bypass); the
    env-derived contract is the mitigation.

    Does NOT touch ``driving_session_id`` — the boss remains the primary owner,
    and only the boss's session is exempt from the action gate's operator-pause
    carve-out (see on-pretooluse-action.py::_owns_session).
