"""auto U6b: the native Claude adapter — Python surface.

This is the module tick.py (U4) imports. `resolve_adapter` (tick.py:170-197)
loads `lib/adapter-native.py`, prefers a module-level ``Adapter`` factory, and
calls the six ops on it: ``next_plan_step(ledger) / plan(ledger) /
deepen(ledger) / review_plan(ledger) / do_unit(unit) / review(unit)``.

The pure logic (severity validation + the plan-step state machine) is here so
tick.py can import it; the bash sibling ``adapter-native.sh`` mirrors it as a
CLI for direct testing. An adapter NEVER writes the ledger (contract §1).

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RUBRIC PROBE OUTCOME (gates this adapter — contract §3.1, plan U6b "FIRST"):

  A native reviewer is a Claude model judging findings against the
  blocker/major/minor rubric. The probe gave it 5 representative findings:
    1. SQL injection (unsanitized input)            -> blocker  (clear)
    2. Missing await: response before DB commit      -> blocker  (clear)
    3. Off-by-one pagination drops last record       -> major*   (HEDGED)
    4. Redundant local var, could be inlined         -> minor*   (HEDGED)
    5. Comment typo                                  -> minor    (clear)

  OUTCOME: **partial**. The blocker tier is reliable (security/correctness/
  data-loss tag unambiguously); the major/minor boundary HEDGED on 2 of 5
  (bounded correctness bug vs. code smell). Per the contract's partial rule,
  a hedge on even one major/minor finding drops us off "three-tier".

  THEREFORE adapter_scale = "blocker-only". The predicate evaluator applies
  blocker-only logic for native runs: only `blocker` reliably gates the loop.
  R2's "widest gap" rationale is PARTIALLY met — the blocker gate is
  trustworthy, the major gate is best-effort. Native `review` still emits the
  full three-tier scale (it is the single shared scale); the engine treats
  native majors as advisory rather than gating.
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PLAN-STEP STATE: `next_plan_step` reads `ledger["plan_step"]` (the plan-phase
sub-state, schema §3.1); the tick persists the executed step via
`set_loop(plan_step=step)` after each plan-loop advance (tick_advance.py), so a
fresh-process tick reads the real sub-state and the loop advances rather than
livelocking. (Native never emits "deepen": plan → review_plan → done.)

DECLARED SEVERITY MAPPING (contract §3.1): native reviewers self-tag directly on
the shared scale (no foreign vocabulary), so the "mapping" is the injected
rubric (``review_rubric``); ``validate_findings`` rejects anything off-scale.
