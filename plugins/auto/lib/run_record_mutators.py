"""auto run-record mutators: grammar-checked, flock-serialized write paths.

The mutation layer of the run-record surface (see lib/run_record.py for the facade and
docs/contracts/run-record-schema.md for the authoritative spec). Every function here
routes through ``run_record_core._with_locked_run_record`` (the one RMW primitive), which
recomputes the predicate in the SAME atomic snapshot as the write (I-1). Each is a
single-purpose mutator: ``transition``, ``record_verdict``, ``set_loop``,
``set_gaps_open``,
``set_enumerated_steps``, ``set_winner_step_id``,
``set_verdict_decision``, ``set_bound_override``, ``set_driving_session_id``,
``append_advisor_audit``, ``set_exit_reason``, ``accumulate_active_time``,
``increment_iteration_attempts``. The AGENT-facing steering verbs
(``force_skip``, ``add_step``, ``reshape_deps``, ``register_session``) live in
``run_record_steering``, which imports this module for its two graph helpers.

Sits ABOVE run_record_core in the acyclic DAG (core ← mutators ← producers ← facade):
imports run_record_core for constants, errors, the lock primitive, and the pure
helpers; imports NOTHING from producers or the facade.

    phase-transition producer (U5b) reads it from here when emitting work steps —
    so this is the on-run-record bridge between "the plan finished" and "here are its

    depends_on GUARD (U14 P2 anti-livelock): each item's model-emitted
    ``depends_on`` is sanitized here — the single chokepoint where runtime model
    output enters the run-record. An edge that names no known id (dangling), a step's

    never fires, ``all_steps_terminal`` false FOREVER → a silent full-run
    livelock. The workflow-authored path already rejects unknown-id references at
    author time (``workflows._validate_depends_on``).

    DROP, don't raise (deliberate divergence from ``set_winner_step_id``, which
    raises on a bad single reference): this validates a whole BATCH of runtime
    model output, and a raise would abort the persist → the plan phase
    materializes ZERO work steps → also a stall. So invalid edges are dropped and
    recorded on ``dispatch_context.dropped_depends_on_edges`` (a durable, testable
    forensic marker) plus a one-line stderr warning, and the run continues.

def increment_iteration_attempts(repo_root, run_id, gate_step_id):
    """Atomic ``iteration_attempts += 1``. KTD §D / U2.

    Called by U4's ``advance_iteration_loop`` when honoring an iterate decision
    (NOT when the bound-override path forces exit — overrides do not count as
    honored attempts). The pre-increment value drives the bound check in
    ``iteration.evaluate_decision`` so the Nth attempt is checked BEFORE its
    decision is honored: if a pulse reads iteration_attempts==max, the override
    fires; the counter only crosses max via this call when the prior pulse
    honored the (max-1)-th iterate.

    Composite path (``atomic_iterate_step``) inlines this increment instead of
    calling here — the F3 deadlock guard. The standalone mutator exists for
    completeness (tests, future paths) and for the deliberate-fail #6 control.

    ``gate_step_id`` is required (and validated) so the increment can NEVER be
    silently called against a missing/typo'd gate — defensive. The value is
    the new count; the return is the new count for caller convenience.
