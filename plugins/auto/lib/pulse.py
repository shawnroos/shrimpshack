"""auto U4: one ScheduleWakeup-paced advance of the run-record.

A *pulse* is the step of execution. Each pulse does exactly ONE smallest-useful
advance of the loop, then re-arms its own successor via `ScheduleWakeup`. The
pulse reads ALL loop state from the disk run-record (the durable source of truth) —
it runs in a subprocess and treats conversation context as irrelevant, so it is
safe under the non-stateless re-injection of a `ScheduleWakeup`-fired pulse.

THE RE-ARM BOUNDARY (read this — it is the load-bearing handoff):

    `ScheduleWakeup` is a MODEL TOOL, not a CLI. pulse.py CANNOT call it.
    Instead, pulse.py COMPUTES the re-arm intent and emits it on stdout as a
    JSON object:

        {"action": "rearm",  "delay": 60, "prompt": "/auto:auto-pulse <run>", ...}
        {"action": "stop",   "reason": "predicate-met" | "handoff-pause", ...}
        {"action": "noop",   "reason": "lock-held-by-live-pulse"}

    The shell/driver layer (the model driving the pulse) reads this and, when
    action == "rearm", issues the actual `ScheduleWakeup(delay, prompt)` tool
    call. Do NOT look for a ScheduleWakeup binary — there isn't one.

The pulse NEVER dispatches (the dispatcher owns `pending → dispatched`) and
NEVER writes verdicts (each background agent self-writes its own `findings[]`).
The pulse only:
  * reads the run-record,
  * detects stalled steps and halts them + their transitive dependents while
    advancing independent siblings (the parallel-fan-out promise),
  * does ONE advance (plan-loop: the backend's next_plan_step; work-loop: apply
    ONE fix from a converged verdict) inside a try/except,
  * writes the run-record atomically via run_record.py (I-1 recompute happens inside
    run_record.py's single write chokepoint) and stamps loop.last_beat_at,
  * computes the re-arm intent.

Crash-safety: the atomic run-record write (run_record.py) and the re-arm output are
ordered so that a crash after the write but before the re-arm leaves a
*consistent* run-record whose missing successor is exactly what U7's orphan check
catches (→ manual /auto-resume). We persist BEFORE we signal re-arm (R10).

    Predicate met? Route PHASE-AWARELY (gap #4 — the met-check must NOT
    preempt the handoff). I-3: keep liveness honest by NOT stamping a beat for
    the terminal `done` exit but flipping driver to manual so an orphan
    check never mistakes a finished run for a live self-paced one.
      * WORK-met (or handoff) → done (terminal exit, emit report).
      * PLAN-met → fall through to the plan branch so `_maybe_handoff` routes
        it to handoff (manual) or work (auto); `done` is NEVER a plan exit.
    A handoff-phase pulse has its own branch below (re-affirm pause).

    v0.3.0 / KTD §A: the short-circuit is BOTH composed at the predicate
    layer (`recompute_predicate` AND-NOTs iteration_pending into `met` at
    run_record.py:441-442) AND defensively re-checked here. The redundant guard
    is belt-and-braces: if U2's composition ever drifts (or a future caller
    bypasses recompute_predicate), this guard still protects the iteration
    loop from being short-circuited as "predicate-met" before
    advance_iteration_loop can write the bound-exit / iterate-step.

    The downstream short-circuit at the "predicate-met-after-advance" path
    below is untouched — by the time it fires, advance_iteration_loop has
    ALREADY run at the top of this body and either stopped (bound-exit),
    iterated (returned a rearm), or signalled "no iteration" (effective is
    None or "advance"). Guarding both would risk dropping a real terminal
    exit on the advance branch; deliberate-fail #2 proves this guard +
    the iteration check are jointly load-bearing.
