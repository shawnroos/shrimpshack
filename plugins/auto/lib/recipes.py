"""auto U2/U3/U7 (v0.2.0): recipe format, validator, and three-tier registry.

A *recipe* is a named, file-backed JSON declaration of a workflow topology — the
initial-ledger shape `/auto` builds a run from. This module is the SINGLE place
recipes are validated and resolved; both the engine loader (at run start) and the
authoring skill (at write time) call `validate()` / `validate_and_lint()` here, so
a recipe the skill writes is exactly what the engine will accept (one validator,
two callers — KTD-2).

VALIDATION IS HAND-ROLLED (no `jsonschema` dependency). The plugin ships pure
stdlib + bash to arbitrary repos via a marketplace; adding a pip dependency would
break install-anywhere. `recipes/schema.json` documents the shape; `validate()`
enforces the specific load-bearing rules mechanically below.

This file is built across three units:
  U2 — `validate()` + the format rules (this is the impl half).
  U3 — `resolve()`, `list_available()`, `load_and_validate()`, `unit_for()`,
       `validate_and_lint()` (the three-tier registry).
  U7 — `A1_BUILTIN` constant.
