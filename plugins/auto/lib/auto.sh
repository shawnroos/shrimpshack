# auto: the /auto run-creation entry point (the path the engine
# otherwise lacks).
#
# /auto initializes a NEW run from a plan/spec: it creates the durable
# run-record at <repo>/.claude/auto/<run-slug>.json (loop_phase="plan", empty
# steps — the plan-loop populates work steps later via the backend), and emits
# an arm-first-pulse INTENT (JSON) that the MODEL acts on by setting the
# deliberate-stop /goal and firing the first ScheduleWakeup /auto:auto-pulse.
#
# Subcommands / flags (Claude Code does not dispatch space-separated
# subcommands, so the argument string is PARSED HERE — never in the .md body,
# per memory `feedback_slash_command_arg_substitution`):
#   <plan-or-spec>            required: start a run from this plan/spec file.
#   ... auto                  skip the plan->work handoff pause (pulse gets --auto).
#   ... --backend ce|native   workflow backend (default ce).
#   ... --goal "<text>"       compound deliberate-stop goal (default: the loop's
#                             own exit predicate).
#
# DOUBLE-DRIVE GUARD: run creation routes through run_record.py::init_run_record, which
# holds the per-run init flock across the existence-check + atomic write (two
# concurrent inits cannot both win — one raises RunRecordExists). The "arm first
# pulse" path emits a re-arm INTENT (JSON) that the MODEL acts on by firing
# /auto:auto-pulse; the pulse then acquires its OWN non-blocking process-held
# _pulse_lock (lib/pulse.py::_pulse_lock) which is the actual double-drive guard.
# Adding a flock here would deadlock against the pulse. So: init inherits the
# init flock; arm-first-pulse defers to the pulse's process-held lock. Both are
# flock-based and released on clean exit — there is NO file sentinel to go stale.
#
# Pins the interpreter to /usr/bin/python3 (overridable via
# CLAUDE_AUTO_PYTHON3) — never bare `python3` (rationale parity:
# claude-modes/lib/mode-yaml.sh:24-32, matches lib/run_record.sh / lib/auto-resume.sh).
#
# $ARGUMENTS-safe: the command .md body's only $-bearing line is
#   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/auto.sh" "$ARGUMENTS"
# ALL $-logic lives HERE; dispatch.py parses argv positionally and never
# string-interpolates into a shell.
