"""auto U7 (v0.2.0): the ONE ASCII topology renderer (KTD-10).

`render(recipe, width_hint)` turns any recipe dict into a compact ASCII card.
Called from THREE surfaces — the picker (U8, in the AskUserQuestion preview),
the authoring skill (U9, showing a draft back), and auto-status (the run's
topology). One renderer = the three surfaces can't drift (the same "two
validators" anti-pattern KTD-2 guards against, applied to rendering).

It derives the card from recipe STRUCTURE (phase_order spine, units grouped by
phase, depends_on edges, phase_transitions emit-boundaries) — so a user-authored
recipe renders just like a built-in. No hardcoded per-recipe art.

Loaded via `_bootstrap.load_lib_module("topology-render")` (hyphenated file).
Pure stdlib; deterministic (stable ordering) so tests can assert exact output.
