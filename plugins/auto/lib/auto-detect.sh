# auto v0.4.0 U1: smart-entry hypothesis detector (READ-ONLY).
#
# Bare `/auto` should "gather context and determine where to pick up" (field
# feedback 2026-05-25). The DETECTION is deterministic and lives here
# (deterministic-over-probabilistic for load-bearing infra). The ROUTING — what
# the driver does with the verdict — lives in `skills/auto-driver`.
#
# v0.4.0 (this version): emits a JSON HYPOTHESIS object instead of a TSV
# verdict line. The decision tree itself is unchanged from v0.2.x's tested
# logic; the *output shape* changed so the driver consumes one envelope rather
# than enumerating a verdict-tree case-by-case. KTD-1 of the v0.4.0 plan.
#
# JSON envelope (one line, machine-parseable):
#   {
#     "situation": "in-flight" | "ambiguous-runs" | "reviewed-plan"
#                | "multi-plan" | "conversation-context" | "raw",

#       * "choice" — N-option pick-one. Maps to AskUserQuestion's options array.
#         NOT necessarily 2 — N may be 2..N. Surfaces: ambiguous-runs +
#         stale in-flight (options carry `run_id`); multi-plan (per-plan options
#         carry `path`, plus a null-`path` fan-out-all option). The payload key
#         per option is situation-specific — the driver table says which.
#       * "open"   — freeform text (raw surface). Maps to AskUserQuestion's
#         open-question shape; `options` is the empty array.

#     "recommendation": null  (v0.6.0 U1 — present on EVERY envelope, incl. the
#                       catastrophic-error fallback; the detector has no
#                       transcript access so it always emits null. The DRIVER
#                       computes the real recommendation in U2/U3 — see
#                       skills/auto-driver + lib/recommender.py.)
#   }
#
# Situations:
#   in-flight       — exactly ONE run with exit_predicate_result.met == false.
#                     `in_flight.run_id` carries the run. FRESH run (ledger
#                     touched within CLAUDE_AUTO_INFLIGHT_TTL_SECONDS, default
#                     1 day) → ambiguity null → driver resumes silently. STALE
#                     run (idle past the TTL) → ambiguity is a choice (resume vs
#                     start-fresh) so the driver ASKS rather than silently
#                     auto-resuming an abandoned run (2026-06 misfire fix).
#   ambiguous-runs  — MORE THAN ONE in-flight run; ambiguity carries a binary
#                     options array of run-ids + their goal_intent strings so
#                     AskUserQuestion shows what each run was started for.
#   reviewed-plan   — no in-flight run; exactly one reviewed plan present.
#                     single_plan.path filled; ambiguity null.
#   multi-plan      — no run, MORE THAN ONE plan. multi_plan.paths filled.
#                     v0.4.0 made this a SILENT fanout (ambiguity null, one
#                     worktree per plan via auto-spawn.py). The 2026-06 misfire
#                     showed auto-spawning N worktrees on whatever plans sit in
#                     docs/plans/ is the highest-blast-radius path — so it now
#                     sets `ambiguity` (a choice: run one plan, or fan out all)
#                     and the driver CONFIRMS before spawning. situation stays
#                     multi-plan and paths are preserved for a confirmed fanout.
#   conversation-context (v0.6.0 U1; v0.7.x U3) — no in-flight run and no LIVE
#                     plan (no plan at all, OR every discovered plan is STALE),
#                     but the DRIVER has signalled a rich current conversation
#                     worth routing on (env var CLAUDE_AUTO_CONVERSATION_SIGNAL
#                     set). A stale plan set no longer blocks it — but a FRESH
#                     plan (reviewed-plan) still wins over conversation.
#                     The detector has no transcript access (single-quote
#                     heredoc), so it cannot self-detect the conversation — it
#                     only honours the driver's signal. It emits the situation
#                     with an EMPTY (null) recommendation + ambiguity null; the
#                     driver classifies state + calls lib/recommender.py to fill
#                     in the recommendation, then dispatches or pre-dispatch
#                     escalates (skills/auto-driver, KTD-2/3/7). Without the
#                     signal this branch is skipped entirely and the engine
#                     falls through to `raw` (byte-unchanged from v0.4.x).
#   raw             — no run, no plan (clean OR dirty tree). ambiguity is an
#                     open "what should we work on?" question so the driver
#                     can route to /ce-plan or a freeform handoff. When the
#                     working tree is dirty, summary includes branch + diff
#                     context so the operator sees what they were doing —
#                     but the situation is still raw because there's no
#                     deterministic dispatch from a diff alone.
