# auto v0.4.0 U1: smart-entry hypothesis detector (READ-ONLY).
#
# Bare `/auto` should "gather context and determine where to pick up" (field
# feedback 2026-05-25). The DETECTION is deterministic and lives here
# (deterministic-over-probabilistic for load-bearing infra). The ROUTING — what
# the driver does with the verdict — lives in `skills/auto-driver`.
#
# v0.4.0 (this version): emits a JSON HYPOTHESIS object instead of a TSV
# verdict line. The decision tree itself is unchanged from v0.2.x's tested
# logic; the *output shape* changed so the driver consumes one envelope rather
# than enumerating a verdict-tree case-by-case. KTD-1 of the v0.4.0 plan.
#
# JSON envelope (one line, machine-parseable):
#   {
#     "situation": "in-flight" | "ambiguous-runs" | "reviewed-plan"
#                | "multi-plan" | "raw",
#     "summary":   "one-line operator-facing description",
#     "ambiguity": null | { "kind": "choice"|"open",
#                           "question": "...",
#                           "options": [ {"label":"…","run_id":"…","description":"…"}* ] },
#       * "choice" — N-option pick-one (ambiguous-runs surface). Maps to
#         AskUserQuestion's options array. NOT necessarily 2 — N may be 2..N.
#       * "open"   — freeform text (raw surface). Maps to AskUserQuestion's
#         open-question shape; `options` is the empty array.
#     "single_plan": { "path": "...", "run_id_hint": "..." } | null,
#     "multi_plan":  { "paths": ["..."], "batch_id_hint": "..." } | null,
#     "in_flight":   { "run_id": "...", "run_ids": ["..."] } | null
#   }
#
# Situations:
#   in-flight       — exactly ONE run with exit_predicate_result.met == false.
#                     `single_plan` carries the run via in_flight.run_id;
#                     ambiguity null → driver resumes silently.
#   ambiguous-runs  — MORE THAN ONE in-flight run; ambiguity carries a binary
#                     options array of run-ids + their goal_intent strings so
#                     AskUserQuestion shows what each run was started for.
#   reviewed-plan   — no in-flight run; exactly one reviewed plan present.
#                     single_plan.path filled; ambiguity null.
#   multi-plan      — no run, MORE THAN ONE plan. multi_plan.paths filled;
#                     ambiguity null (the driver fans out via auto-spawn.py).
#                     v0.4.0 RENAME of v0.2.x's `ambiguous-plans` — under the
#                     v0.4.0 fanout model, multiple plans is a fanout signal,
#                     not an ambiguity to resolve. (KTD-1.)
#   raw             — no run, no plan (clean OR dirty tree). ambiguity is an
#                     open "what should we work on?" question so the driver
#                     can route to /ce-plan or a freeform handoff. When the
#                     working tree is dirty, summary includes branch + diff
#                     context so the operator sees what they were doing —
#                     but the situation is still raw because there's no
#                     deterministic dispatch from a diff alone.
#
# READ-ONLY: scans the ledger dir + plan dirs + git status; never writes.
# Repo root resolved by the Python (CLAUDE_AUTO_REPO or walk-up).
#
# Hypothesis-shape stability (NO TSV legacy): the previous TSV consumer was
# `skills/auto-driver` only (one consumer, updated lock-step in U4). No
# back-compat wrapper, no shim — the JSON output is the contract.
