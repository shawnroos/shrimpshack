"""auto U9 (v0.6.0): the pure upstream-cluster classifier.

Given a review verdict's findings + their reviewer-role/lens metadata, decide
whether they CLUSTER on a single UPSTREAM phase — i.e. the flaw is inherited
from an earlier creative-spine stage (brainstorm/plan) rather than being a
local issue in the current phase. The engine (lib/pulse_advance.py) calls this
during a spine run and, on a positive detection, ESCALATES the cluster to the
operator via the existing pause handoff (driver=manual + blocked_on). No backward
loop_phase move, no new persisted field, no rebound machinery — that autonomous
backward edge is deferred to v0.7.0 (KTD-6). v0.6.0 ships the detection half.

THE WEIGHTING (KTD-6 — `feedback_a1_recipe_cant_rebound_to_brainstorm`):
REVIEWER-ROLE DIVERSITY is weighted ABOVE raw finding count. Three findings
from three DISTINCT roles (adversarial + feasibility + security) all attributing
to the SAME upstream phase is a far stronger signal than N findings from ONE
role on local issues — independent lenses converging on the same root cause is
what makes an upstream flaw credible. So the trigger is "≥ MIN_DISTINCT_ROLES
distinct reviewer roles attribute to ONE upstream phase", NOT a count threshold.
The "many same-role local findings" negative case falls out for free: one role
contributes distinct-role-count == 1 to any phase, below the threshold.

WHERE THE METADATA LIVES (the `decision` / `winner_step_id` precedent —
lib/iteration.py, lib/run_record_mutators.set_winner_step_id): `record_verdict`
NORMALIZES findings to ``{severity, note}`` only (lib/run_record_mutators.py:150),
so any reviewer-role / target-phase tag on a finding is STRIPPED on the
canonical write path. Role-tagged findings therefore survive on the step's
``dispatch_context`` (preserved by ``transition`` / the verdict-write path with
no normalize step), exactly as the iteration ``decision`` does. This classifier
reads a list of finding-records of the shape::

    {"role": <reviewer-role str>, "phase": <attributed-phase str>, ...}

The PRODUCER that tags review findings with role + attributed-phase (a review-op
enrichment writing them onto ``dispatch_context``) is OUT OF SCOPE for U9 — U9
is the detector + the escalation wiring, not the enrichment. Until a producer
populates these tags the classifier simply returns "no cluster" (degrade-safe).

PURE + STDLIB-ONLY (import-topology / pure-leaf discipline): this module imports
NO lib siblings — it takes the current phase + phase order as ARGS (never reads
``run_record["loop_phase"]``, which would trip the phase-grammar AST lint) and never
writes the run-record. That makes it a trivially-testable leaf and adds only the one
edge ``pulse_advance → upstream_cluster`` to the import DAG.

DEGRADE-SAFE (never crash a run-record write path): every accessor tolerates a
malformed/partial finding record (non-dict entries, missing/blank role or phase,
a non-list ``findings`` arg, a non-list ``phase_order``). On ANY malformed shape
the classifier collapses to the safe default — ``detected=False`` — so a torn
verdict can never raise out of the work-loop and get mis-recorded as a stall.

Loaded via ``_bootstrap.load_lib_module("upstream-cluster")`` (hyphenated file
name per repo convention; the registered module name is ``upstream_cluster``).
