"""auto one-shot preset helpers (addressable-step-contents).

THIN, pure/testable pieces the `auto-preset` skill calls to run a preset
one-shot (KTD-3 — the skill is the dispatcher; this module holds no control
flow, no pulse, no `/goal`):

  1. ``validate_oneshot_criteria(criteria)`` (U3) — validate a RATIFIED criteria
     list against the verification taxonomy BEFORE dispatch, reusing the workflow
     validator's shape check (KTD-2 reuse).

  2. ``build_oneshot_launch(preset, repo)`` (U5) — build the driver-side launch
     descriptor: the preset's `backend_op`, plus the `prompt_template` body when
     the preset declares one (KTD-5 — the tuning is folded at the DRIVER launch,
     never via a backend edit).

  3. ``oneshot_verdict(ratified_criteria, programmatic_results, judge_verdicts)``
     (U4) — the TERMINAL verdict: fold the ratified criteria + resolved results
     into a single ``verification.aggregate`` call and re-label the aggregator's
     advance/iterate SIGNAL as a terminal ``pass``/``fail`` (KTD-1). It takes the
     ratified criteria list DIRECTLY (there is no synthesized step) and is
     READ-ONLY over them: it reports a verdict, it does NOT commit an iteration
     decision.

KTD-1 BOUNDARY (defended in review + import-topology): this module MUST NOT import
`lib/iteration.py` (the iteration-decision-commit module) and MUST NOT write a
`decision` field anywhere. The one-shot verdict is a terminal read of the pure
evaluator, distinct from the looping workflow's gate. It reuses ONLY
`verification.aggregate` — the same pure primitive
`iteration.resolve_gate_verification` folds through, but reached HERE independently
(pattern reuse, not a call into iteration). `verification` is a stdlib-safe leaf
loaded at import; the KTD-1 boundary is about `iteration`, not `verification`.

    DRIVER-SIDE ONLY. The one-shot is driver-orchestrated (KTD-3), so the load-
    bearing site for "a preset's tuning reaches the dispatched agent" is the
    DRIVER launch, NOT a backend edit — ``dispatcher.dispatch_batch`` never
    consults the backend (driver-reference §7). This helper is what the
    ``auto-preset`` skill calls to assemble that launch:

      - it always names the preset's ``backend_op``;
      - when the preset declares a ``prompt_template``, it folds the template's
        BODY into the descriptor (``prompt_template`` = the path, ``prompt_template_body``
        = the file text) so the skill can splice the tuning into the sub-agent's
        prompt;
      - when the preset declares NO ``prompt_template``, the descriptor is the
        plain op invocation — no template keys at all (regression-safe: a
        template-less preset launches exactly as before).

    ``preset`` is a VALIDATED preset dict (see ``lib/presets.py::validate_preset``
    / ``load_and_validate_preset``), so ``invokes`` and ``invokes.backend_op`` are
    accessed directly — the validator guarantees them.

    The relative ``prompt_template`` path is re-path-bounded (defensively — same
    ``_check_prompt_template`` the workflow/preset validators use) and resolved
    against the workspace ``repo`` first (a workspace override wins, matching
    ``load_preset``'s tier order), then the auto plugin root (where built-in seeds
    ship). A declared-but-unreadable template FAILS CLOSED with a ``WorkflowError``
    rather than launching a half-tuned agent.
