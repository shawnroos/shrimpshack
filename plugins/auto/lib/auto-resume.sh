# auto U7: the /auto-resume manual floor (F4).
#
# A self-paced ScheduleWakeup pulse chain does NOT survive a full session exit.
# No work is lost (durable run-record; agents self-write verdicts atomically); resume
# after any suspend is this one cheap command, reading the durable run-record fresh.
# Resume is also the routine long-run continuation path, not just the crash path.
#
# Subcommands (Claude Code does not dispatch space-separated subcommands, so the
# subcommand is PARSED HERE from the argument string — never in the .md body,
# per memory `feedback_slash_command_arg_substitution`):
#   [<run>]              default `continue`: arm a fresh pulse chain (flips a
#                        paused handoff -> work first if needed).
#   continue <run>       explicit continue (handoff -> work, arm a pulse).
#   abort <run>          flip the run to loop_phase="done" (cancellation).
#   retry <run> <step>   stalled step -> pending; clears last_error.
#   skip <run> <step>    stalled step -> terminal-skip (counts as terminal).
#
# DOUBLE-DRIVE GUARD (process-held flock, released on clean exit — NO stale
# sentinel file): this script ADDS NO NEW FLOCK. State transitions route through
# run_record.py (set_loop / transition), which holds the per-run RMW flock for the
# whole read-modify-write. The "arm a pulse" path emits a re-arm INTENT (JSON)
# that the MODEL acts on by firing /auto:auto-pulse; the pulse then acquires its
# OWN non-blocking _pulse_lock (lib/pulse.py::_pulse_lock — process-held, released
# on exit) which is the actual double-drive guard. Adding a third flock here
# would deadlock against the pulse. So: transitions inherit the RMW lock;
# arm-a-pulse defers to the pulse's process-held lock. Both are flock-based and
# released on clean exit — there is NO file sentinel to go stale.
#
# Pins the interpreter to /usr/bin/python3 (overridable via
# CLAUDE_AUTO_PYTHON3) — never bare `python3` (rationale parity:
# claude-modes/lib/mode-yaml.sh:24-32, matches lib/run_record.sh / lib/pulse.sh).
#
# $ARGUMENTS-safe: the command .md body's only $-bearing line is
#   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/auto-resume.sh" "$ARGUMENTS"
# ALL $-logic lives HERE; resume.py parses argv positionally and never
# string-interpolates into a shell.
