"""auto U7: /auto-resume subcommand logic behind resume.sh.

Parses the resume argument string into a subcommand and applies the run-record
transition via run_record.py (so the per-run RMW flock is inherited — no new flock).

Subcommands:
    [<run>]            default continue: re-record the driving session (so the
                       advisor gates own the re-armed run — fix-round-6 P1),
                       flip a paused handoff -> work, then emit a re-arm INTENT
                       (the model fires /auto:auto-pulse).
    continue <run>     explicit continue (same as default with a run-id).
    pause <run> [why]  blocked on a human/external action (auth, approval,
                       missing creds): flip driver -> "manual" so the Stop hook
                       stops blocking and the driver stops yielding, record the
                       reason, and stay resumable. Resume with `continue` once
                       the human acts. NOT a cancellation (use abort for that).
    advance <run>      declare the CURRENT phase already satisfied and move on
                       (v0.4.3 KTD-15). The "the plan is done — stop re-planning
                       it" tool: in the plan phase it marks the plan satisfied
                       (plan_step=review_plan, gaps_open=0) so the next pulse goes
                       straight to enumerate -> work; at a handoff it behaves like
                       continue; in the work phase it is a no-op (work advances by
                       step verdicts, not by fiat).
    abort <run>        loop_phase -> "done" (cancellation marker).
    retry <run> <step> stalled step -> pending (clears last_error via run_record.py).
    skip <run> <step>  stalled step -> terminal-skip (terminal for I-2).

Ambiguity: if no run-id is given and >1 run is resumable, list them and ask the
operator to disambiguate (exit 0 — surfacing, not an error).

DOUBLE-DRIVE: state transitions route through run_record.py (RMW flock); the
arm-a-pulse path emits intent only — the pulse's own non-blocking process-held
_pulse_lock is the double-drive guard. No new flock here (would deadlock the
pulse). No file sentinel.

rel-001-ish: a clean usage/disambiguation message exits 0; only a genuine bad
transition exits non-zero (so the operator sees the error).

    fix-round-6 P1. A re-armed run becomes self-driven again, so the advisor-gate

    ``driving_session_id == stdin.session_id``. Resume is the common cross-session
    case (after a handoff pause, a crash, or the next day from a fresh window), so
    the stale arm-time id would never match the NEW driving session and BOTH gates
    (question redirect AND the destructive-action backstop) would fall through to

    warning) in two cases:

       NOT pass None to ``set_driving_session_id`` (None CLEARS the field, failing

    2. OWNERSHIP-STEAL guard (review #5): the run is currently LIVE and self-driven

       that ``is_orphaned`` is False). Re-recording would silently hand the backstop
