"""auto U4: one ScheduleWakeup-paced advance of the ledger.

A *tick* is the unit of execution. Each tick does exactly ONE smallest-useful
advance of the loop, then re-arms its own successor via `ScheduleWakeup`. The
tick reads ALL loop state from the disk ledger (the durable source of truth) —
it runs in a subprocess and treats conversation context as irrelevant, so it is
safe under the non-stateless re-injection of a `ScheduleWakeup`-fired tick.

THE RE-ARM BOUNDARY (read this — it is the load-bearing seam):

    `ScheduleWakeup` is a MODEL TOOL, not a CLI. tick.py CANNOT call it.
    Instead, tick.py COMPUTES the re-arm intent and emits it on stdout as a
    JSON object:

        {"action": "rearm",  "delay": 60, "prompt": "/auto-tick <run>", ...}
        {"action": "stop",   "reason": "predicate-met" | "seam-pause", ...}
        {"action": "noop",   "reason": "lock-held-by-live-tick"}

    The shell/driver layer (the model driving the tick) reads this and, when
    action == "rearm", issues the actual `ScheduleWakeup(delay, prompt)` tool
    call. Do NOT look for a ScheduleWakeup binary — there isn't one.

The tick NEVER dispatches (the orchestrator owns `pending → dispatched`) and
NEVER writes verdicts (each background agent self-writes its own `findings[]`).
The tick only:
  * reads the ledger,
  * detects stalled units and halts them + their transitive dependents while
    advancing independent siblings (the parallel-fan-out promise),
  * does ONE advance (plan-loop: the adapter's next_plan_step; work-loop: apply
    ONE fix from a converged verdict) inside a try/except,
  * writes the ledger atomically via ledger.py (I-1 recompute happens inside
    ledger.py's single write chokepoint) and stamps loop.last_beat_at,
  * computes the re-arm intent.

Crash-safety: the atomic ledger write (ledger.py) and the re-arm output are
ordered so that a crash after the write but before the re-arm leaves a
*consistent* ledger whose missing successor is exactly what U7's orphan check
catches (→ manual /auto-resume). We persist BEFORE we signal re-arm (R10).
