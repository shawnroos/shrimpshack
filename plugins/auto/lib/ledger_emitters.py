"""auto ledger emitters: phase-transition + iteration emission/composite paths.

The emission layer of the ledger surface (see lib/ledger.py for the facade and
docs/contracts/ledger-schema.md for the authoritative spec). Holds the shared
emit/validate/append helper (``_emit_units_core``), the phase-transition primitive
(``transition_and_emit``), the in-phase iteration emit (``emit_within_phase`` +
``_apply_emit``), and the gate-unit re-engagement combo (``reset_for_iteration`` +
``_reset_gate_for_iteration`` + ``atomic_iterate_step``).

Sits ABOVE ledger_core and ledger_mutators in the acyclic DAG
(core ← mutators ← emitters ← facade). All write paths route through
``ledger_core._with_locked_ledger``; the composite paths inline their sub-step
bodies inside ONE outer locked body (the F3 deadlock guard — calling a public
mutator from inside a locked mutate() would re-acquire the flock on a fresh fd
and deadlock).

    new phase with zero emitted units, and `recompute_predicate` could fire
    ``met`` prematurely (e.g. A2's judge terminal → all_units_terminal with no
    work units yet). Doing both inside one ``_with_locked_ledger`` body closes
    that window: the emitter's units are appended BEFORE ``_atomic_write``'s
    mandatory predicate recompute, so ``met`` is always computed against the
    post-emission unit set.
