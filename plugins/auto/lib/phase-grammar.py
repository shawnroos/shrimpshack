"""auto U5 (v0.2.0): the ONE phase-grammar decision point.

Every site that used to branch on the `loop_phase` string literal — the pulse's
phase switch, the handoff/phase-advance handler, `recompute_predicate`'s phase-aware
branch, `_ready_fix_step`'s phase-awareness, and auto-status's reporting — reads
through THIS module instead of comparing `run_record["loop_phase"]` to a literal.

WHY centralize (memory `feedback_plan_documents_transition_code_doesnt_wire_it`):
the dominant v0.1.x build-bug class was "a rule the prose describes that the code
enforces in some sites but not its siblings." Phase ordering is exactly that kind
of rule once workflows can declare non-default `phase_order`. One helper = one place
the decision lives; the AST lint (tests/unit/phase-grammar-ast-lint.test.sh)
forbids the string literal "loop_phase" anywhere ELSE in lib/, so a new consumer
physically cannot re-introduce a divergent literal comparison.

WORKFLOW-BLIND DEFAULTS: a v0.1.x run-record has no `phase_order`/`terminal_phase`.
Every accessor here falls back to the legacy grammar (`["plan","handoff","work"]`,
terminal `"work"`) so a workflow-blind run-record routes phases EXACTLY as v0.1.1 did.

Loaded via `_bootstrap.load_lib_module("phase-grammar")` (the file name is
hyphenated per repo convention; the registered module name is `phase_grammar`).
