"""auto ledger: persistence, transitions, concurrency.

Canonical implementation of docs/contracts/ledger-schema.md. That document
is the authoritative spec; this module implements it. If they ever disagree,
the contract wins and this file is the bug.

Design notes (the load-bearing correctness rules):

  * I-1 (atomic predicate freshness) is enforced STRUCTURALLY: there is exactly
    ONE serialization chokepoint, ``_atomic_write``, which ALWAYS recomputes
    ``exit_predicate_result`` (including ``all_units_terminal``) immediately
    before writing. No public mutator bypasses it. Therefore every writer that
    routes a mutation through this module inherits freshness for free — that is
    what "generalized to ALL writers" means for U10's callers.

  * The flock spans the WHOLE read-modify-write, not just the rename. Holding
    only across the rename would permit a lost update. ``_with_locked_ledger``
    is the only RMW primitive; every mutator goes through it. Lock ACQUISITION
    itself lives in one place — ``_flock_run`` — which both ``_with_locked_ledger``
    and ``init_ledger`` route through. (``init_ledger`` is a create, not an RMW:
    it must succeed only when the ledger is ABSENT, the inverse of the RMW
    primitive's read-existing-first shape, so it shares the lock but not the body.)

  * Atomic write = mkstemp + os.fchmod(0o600) + os.rename, mirroring
    claude-modes/scripts/on-session-start.sh:162-175.

  * Locking via fcntl.flock (NOT flock(1) — macOS lacks it), mirroring
    claude-modes/lib/cascade-engine.sh::with_flock_run.

  * Python pinned /usr/bin/python3 via CLAUDE_AUTO_PYTHON3 (the .sh shim
    pins the interpreter; this file documents the contract).

  * slugify_branch is VENDORED here (``_slugify_branch``) — not cross-imported
    from claude-modes — to avoid cross-plugin coupling. Logic parity with
    claude-modes/lib/validate-mode-name.sh:104-136.

    ``active_wall_seconds < max_wall_seconds``). Without the AND-NOT clause, a
    recipe that emits new plan-N units while ``loop_phase == "work"`` would see
    work-met fire spuriously (the work-loop branch above scopes terminality to
    current-phase units; pending plan-N units are phase=plan, invisible) — see
    KTD §A. The gate-decision read routes through ``iteration.read_decision`` to
    keep ledger.py off the AST-lint's allowlist for that semantic — the lint
    permits the literal here (writer site) but the convention is to consume via

#
# Six new write paths support outcomes-gated emission (KTD §A-D + U2 plan
# section). All share the same atomicity contract as the v0.2.0 mutators:
# each routes through ``_with_locked_ledger``, which recomputes the predicate
# (now including ``iteration_pending``) in the SAME atomic snapshot as the
# write (I-1).
#
# Why the surface is wider than round-1 priced: the round-2 doc-review pinned
# three architectural locks (KTD §A control-flow placement, §B predicate
# composition, §C gate-unit re-engagement) that require dedicated mutators
# rather than letting the tick stitch raw writes — see plan U2 §Approach.
#
# DEADLOCK GUARD (the F3 trap from v0.2.0): `_with_locked_ledger` cannot be
# nested. Any composite path (atomic_iterate_step) MUST inline its sub-step
# bodies inside ONE outer locked body — calling a public mutator from inside a
# locked mutate() would re-acquire the flock on a fresh fd and deadlock. The
# pure helper ``_apply_emit`` below is shared between `emit_within_phase` (one
# locked body) and `atomic_iterate_step` (one locked body) for this reason.
