"""auto ledger: persistence, transitions, concurrency.

Canonical implementation of docs/contracts/ledger-schema.md. That document
is the authoritative spec; this module implements it. If they ever disagree,
the contract wins and this file is the bug.

Design notes (the load-bearing correctness rules):

  * I-1 (atomic predicate freshness) is enforced STRUCTURALLY: there is exactly
    ONE serialization chokepoint, ``_atomic_write``, which ALWAYS recomputes
    ``exit_predicate_result`` (including ``all_units_terminal``) immediately
    before writing. No public mutator bypasses it. Therefore every writer that
    routes a mutation through this module inherits freshness for free — that is
    what "generalized to ALL writers" means for U10's callers.

  * The flock spans the WHOLE read-modify-write, not just the rename. Holding
    only across the rename would permit a lost update. ``_with_locked_ledger``
    is the only RMW primitive; every mutator goes through it. Lock ACQUISITION
    itself lives in one place — ``_flock_run`` — which both ``_with_locked_ledger``
    and ``init_ledger`` route through. (``init_ledger`` is a create, not an RMW:
    it must succeed only when the ledger is ABSENT, the inverse of the RMW
    primitive's read-existing-first shape, so it shares the lock but not the body.)

  * Atomic write = mkstemp + os.fchmod(0o600) + os.rename, mirroring
    claude-modes/scripts/on-session-start.sh:162-175.

  * Locking via fcntl.flock (NOT flock(1) — macOS lacks it), mirroring
    claude-modes/lib/cascade-engine.sh::with_flock_run.

  * Python pinned /usr/bin/python3 via CLAUDE_AUTO_PYTHON3 (the .sh shim
    pins the interpreter; this file documents the contract).

  * slugify_branch is VENDORED here (``_slugify_branch``) — not cross-imported
    from claude-modes — to avoid cross-plugin coupling. Logic parity with
    claude-modes/lib/validate-mode-name.sh:104-136.
