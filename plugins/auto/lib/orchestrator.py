"""auto U10: agent-managed batch fan-out for the work-loop.

The orchestration layer is *agent-driven* and deliberately separate from the
mechanical tick (U4). The DRIVING AGENT (U5) owns the policy — it reads which
units are ready, decides a batch cap for this wave (resizing in flight under
machine pressure), dispatches, then reconciles landed verdicts. The engine here
only exposes ready-and-independent units and reconciles durable state; it never
hardcodes a concurrency constant (R12) and never decides how to parallelize.

Three operations (against the ledger schema contract,
docs/contracts/ledger-schema.md — read THAT, not lib/ledger.py, for the spec):

  * ``ready_units(repo, run)``  -> the unit ids dispatchable RIGHT NOW.
  * ``dispatch_batch(repo, run, unit_ids, cap, *, launch_fn=None)``
        -> marks each chosen unit pending->dispatched (records dispatched_at),
           launches its background agent; REJECTS any unit not in `pending`
           (idempotency guard — pending->dispatched is the only entry).
  * ``converge(repo, run)``  -> a RECONCILE/READ step over durable ledger state.
           It is NOT the verdict-writer.

THE LOAD-BEARING CORRECTNESS PROPERTY (verdict survives session death)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Each dispatched background agent SELF-WRITES its own verdict into the ledger
atomically, via ``ledger.record_verdict`` (the I-1 write chokepoint). The
verdict is durable the moment the agent finishes — independent of whether the
driving session is still alive. So ``converge`` never loses a verdict to a
session death: a resumed session reads completed verdicts straight off the
ledger and does NOT re-dispatch them. The orchestrator's in-flight batch state
(which cap it chose, which handles it holds) is DISPOSABLE; only the durable
per-unit ledger state matters across a resume.

``converge`` is therefore a READER by construction: this module's converge code
path imports ONLY ``read_ledger`` from the ledger — never ``transition`` /
``record_verdict`` / ``set_loop``. A future reviewer cannot add a write to
converge without adding a new write-import, which would be immediately visible.
This mirrors ledger.py's "single chokepoint" discipline for I-1.

THE AGENT-LAUNCH BOUNDARY (documented interface for U5 to wire)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For U10 we implement the orchestration + ledger interactions. The actual
background-agent launch is an INJECTED callable ``launch_fn(unit_id, attempt)``;
U5's driver passes the real wrapper around an ``Agent`` ``run_in_background``
dispatch whose prompt instructs the agent to call ``ledger.record_verdict`` on
completion — passing ``attempt`` so the verdict carries the dispatch generation it
was launched for (Bug #6 attempt-identity). For tests (and a documented default)
``launch_fn`` defaults to a no-op recorder.

The launch fires ONLY AFTER the pending->dispatched transition succeeds — never
launch-then-fail-to-mark, which would orphan a verdict with nothing to link it to.

THE LAUNCH GUARD (Bug #8)
─────────────────────────
``launch_fn`` is real I/O (a background-agent spawn) and CAN raise. The launch is
wrapped in a PER-UNIT try/except: a launch failure marks that unit ``stalled`` with
``last_error = {call:"launch", ...}`` (reusing the ``dispatched -> stalled`` edge —
no new grammar) and records ``"launch-failed:<class>:<msg>"`` in the per-unit
results, then CONTINUES the wave. Without the guard a single launch raise would
leave the unit committed as ``dispatched`` with no agent running (a phantom unit
recoverable only via the stall timeout) AND propagate out of the loop, abandoning
every remaining unit in the wave. The burnt attempt is naturally recorded in the
unit's ``attempt`` counter (incremented at dispatch); the operator can
``/auto-resume retry`` the stalled unit.

ATTEMPT-IDENTITY (Bug #6)
─────────────────────────
Each ``pending -> dispatched`` transition INCREMENTS the unit's ``attempt`` counter
(in the SAME atomic snapshot as the state change, via the transition's ``**fields``
— never a separate write, which would reopen a race). The launched agent carries
this attempt; ``ledger.record_verdict`` rejects a verdict whose attempt is older
than the unit's current attempt (a stale verdict from a superseded retry).

    already-dispatched unit in the list does not block the genuinely-pending ones,
    and one unit's launch failure does not abandon the rest of the wave.

    Idempotency note: an already-``dispatched`` unit fails the
    ``pending -> dispatched`` grammar edge in ledger.py (``transition`` raises
    ``InvalidTransition``), so even a race that slips past the pre-filter cannot
    produce a second ``dispatched_at`` — the transition is the authoritative
