"""auto: smart-entry hypothesis detector — Python surface (U15 split).

The detection logic that used to live in a single-quoted bash heredoc inside
`lib/auto-detect.sh`. U15 (plan 2026-07-01-001) moved it into this sibling
module following the shipped `backend-ce.sh`/`backend-ce.py` precedent (KTD-3):
`auto-detect.sh` is now a thin shim that pins the interpreter, resolves
`script_dir`, and execs this file with `script_dir` as argv[1].

READ-ONLY: scans the run-record dir + plan dirs + git status; never writes. Repo
root resolved via `_bootstrap.resolve_repo` (CLAUDE_AUTO_REPO or walk-up).

The full JSON-envelope contract (situations, slots, staleness TTL) is documented
in `lib/auto-detect.sh`'s header comment — the shim is still the user-facing
entry point and carries the contract prose.

Three duplications the split killed — each now reaches back through `_bootstrap`
(KTD-3: "reach back for shared logic rather than re-inlining"):
  * `_repo_root()` (a clone of `resolve_repo`) → `_bootstrap.resolve_repo`.
  * the importlib load of a sibling lib module (appeared TWICE — for
    `auto-workspace.py` and for `plan-rank.py`) → `_bootstrap.load_lib_module`.
  * `_read_in_flight`'s inline `open`+`json.load`+`isinstance(dict)` guard →
    `_bootstrap.load_run_record_safe`. NOTE: `iter_worktree_run_records` (the helper the
    plan named) yields `(run_id, led)` with NO file mtime and NO path — but the
    detector needs each run-record's mtime for BOTH the single-run staleness gate
    and the freshest-first (mtime-desc) ordering of the ambiguous-runs options.
    So the scan keeps its own glob+getmtime skeleton (byte-identical output) and
    swaps only the parse/guard for `load_run_record_safe` (the exact primitive
    `iter_worktree_run_records` wraps internally).
