"""auto workflow VALIDATION layer (U17 split from workflows.py).

A *workflow* is a named, file-backed JSON declaration of a LOOP topology — an
ordered graph of steps (CONCEPTS.md) — the
initial-run-record shape `/auto` builds a run from. This module is the SINGLE place
workflows are VALIDATED; both the engine loader (at run start) and the authoring
skill (at write time) reach `validate()` / `validate_and_lint()` here (via the
`workflows` facade re-export), so a workflow the skill writes is exactly what the
engine will accept (one validator, two callers — KTD-2).

VALIDATION IS HAND-ROLLED (no `jsonschema` dependency). The plugin ships pure
stdlib + bash to arbitrary repos via a marketplace; adding a pip dependency would
break install-anywhere. `workflows/schema.json` documents the shape; `validate()`
enforces the specific load-bearing rules mechanically below.

U17 (v0.9.0) split lib/workflows.py (~981 LOC) BY CONCERN: this file holds the
validation family (the `_validate_*` helpers + `_bad`, `_check_prompt_template`,
`validate`, `_lint_verification_placement`, `validate_and_lint`), and lib/workflows.py
keeps the thin three-tier REGISTRY facade (resolve / list_available /
load_and_validate / step_for / workspace_workflow_path). This module is a DAG
ROOT — so `WorkflowError` lives HERE and the facade re-exports it, giving
`WorkflowError` importable from both modules with no cycle.
`_BUILTIN_DIR` / `_builtin_names` live here too because `validate_and_lint`'s
description-spoofing guard needs them; the facade re-imports `_BUILTIN_DIR` for
its `_tier_dirs`.

U6 (concept-vocabulary rename): the ONE sibling edge — `format_compat`, the
format-v1→v2 shim. `format_compat` is ITSELF a DAG root (pure stdlib, imports no
sibling), so this is a leaf edge that closes no cycle and the root property is
preserved. It exists because the authoring WRITE gate (`validate_and_lint`) does
not go through the read chokepoints: a model following authoring-skill prose
hands it a v1-keyed draft, which the now-v2 validator would otherwise reject.

def validate_and_lint(workflow: dict, *, filename: str | None = None):
    """``validate`` (hard errors, raises) PLUS editorial lint warnings the engine
    ignores but the authoring skill surfaces (KTD-2). Returns a list of warning
    strings (empty when clean). Call ``validate`` for the contract; this adds:
      - a phase in phase_order with no step assigned (and no producer targeting it)
      - depends_on creating an unreachable step (no path from a root)
      - terminal_phase with no steps AND no producer targeting it
      - a workspace/global workflow whose description matches a built-in verbatim
        (description-spoofing defense — security observation 1)
      - (P2-15) when ``filename`` is supplied: the workflow's declared ``name``
        does not match the file stem. The engine resolves workflows by filename,
        so a name/stem mismatch means a user who runs ``--workflow <stem>`` would
        load this file while a workflow author who reads the ``name:`` field
        expects a different identifier — a UX trap, surfaced here as a warning.

    ``filename`` is optional: the path or basename to compare against (file
    extension stripped if present). When omitted (the engine's load path), the
    name-stem check is skipped — only the skill needs it, since the skill is
    the one choosing the write path.

    U6 — the authoring WRITE-path shim (KTD-1 / F5). The read chokepoints protect
    ``resolve()``, but this WRITE gate does not go through them: a model following
    authoring-skill prose (whose examples still show format-v1 keys until U8) hands
    us a v1-keyed draft, which the now-v2 validator would reject. So we validate an
    internally-UPGRADED COPY. (See the workflow contract's "Legacy keys" appendix
    for the full v1→v2 key map.)

    Two properties this deliberately preserves:
      * The return signature is UNCHANGED — still the warnings LIST.
      * The caller's draft is NOT mutated (``upgrade_workflow`` is pure).

    CONSEQUENCE: a workflow file the authoring flow writes may persist **v1-keyed
    on disk** — the shim never rewrites the caller's draft. That is SAFE: the
    read-compat path (``resolve()`` → ``upgrade_workflow``) is INDEFINITE, so the
    file upgrades in memory every time it is later resolved. One shim, rather than
    chasing every authoring-skill prose example across auto-author-workflow /
    auto-design / auto-launch; it composes with the U8 skill-prose flip.
