"""auto U6b: the Compound Engineering (CE) adapter — Python surface.

This is the module tick.py (U4) imports. `resolve_adapter` (tick.py:170-197)
loads `lib/adapter-ce.py`, prefers a module-level ``Adapter`` factory if present,
and calls the six ops on it: ``next_plan_step(ledger) / plan(ledger) /
deepen(ledger) / review_plan(ledger) / do_unit(unit) / review(unit)``.

The pure, contract-load-bearing logic (severity mapping + the plan-step state
machine) is implemented HERE in Python so tick.py can import it directly. The
bash sibling ``adapter-ce.sh`` exposes the same logic as a CLI for direct
testing / scripting; the two are intentional mirrors.

An adapter is a PURE PROVIDER OF OPERATIONS — it NEVER writes the ledger
(contract §1). Ops return data; the engine persists it through ledger.py.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONTRACT GAP (raise-it-don't-guess, per adapter-contract.md header) — BLOCKS
INTEGRATION, does NOT block the U6b pure deliverable.

  `next_plan_step` needs to know which plan step last ran (plan -> deepen ->
  review_plan). The LOCKED ledger schema (ledger-schema.md §2.1) exposes NO
  field carrying this: its top-level fields are run_id, loop_phase, seam_paused,
  adapter, adapter_scale, exit_predicate_result, units, loop. And tick.py:337
  calls `adapter.next_plan_step(ledger)` then `getattr(adapter, step)(ledger)`
  (tick.py:342-347) but NEVER persists the chosen step back to the ledger.

  Consequence: a fresh-process tick always reads no step-state -> the state
  machine below always returns "plan" -> the plan-loop LIVELOCKS at integration.

  This is a SEAM break between U6b and U3/U4, not a bug in the logic below. The
  state machine + coherence guard are correct against the contract; they just
  have no schema field to read from. Resolution is UPSTREAM — U3/U4 must either:
    (a) add a `plan_step` field to the ledger schema (re-lock), and have tick.py
        persist the executed step after each plan-loop advance, OR
    (b) change the calling convention so tick.py passes the prior step as a hint.

  We read a tolerated `ledger["plan_step"]` IF a future schema adds it (so this
  adapter is correct the moment the gap closes), and degrade safely otherwise.
  We do NOT invent a derivation from loop_phase/gaps_open — those three states
  (not-yet-planned / planned-awaiting-deepen / deepened-awaiting-review) are
  indistinguishable from schema fields, so guessing would be the contract
  violation the header forbids.
