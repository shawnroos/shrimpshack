"""auto U6b: the Compound Engineering (CE) adapter — Python surface.

This is the module tick.py (U4) imports. `resolve_adapter` (tick.py:170-197)
loads `lib/adapter-ce.py`, prefers a module-level ``Adapter`` factory if present,
and calls the six ops on it: ``next_plan_step(ledger) / plan(ledger) /
deepen(ledger) / review_plan(ledger) / do_unit(unit) / review(unit)``.

The pure, contract-load-bearing logic (severity mapping + the plan-step state
machine) is implemented HERE in Python so tick.py can import it directly. The
bash sibling ``adapter-ce.sh`` exposes the same logic as a CLI for direct
testing / scripting; the two are intentional mirrors.

An adapter is a PURE PROVIDER OF OPERATIONS — it NEVER writes the ledger
(contract §1). Ops return data; the engine persists it through ledger.py.

PLAN-STEP STATE: `next_plan_step` reads `ledger["plan_step"]` (the plan-phase
sub-state, schema §3.1) to compute the next step. The tick persists the executed
step via `set_loop(plan_step=step)` after each plan-loop advance
(tick_advance.py), so a fresh-process tick reads the real sub-state — the loop
advances plan → deepen → review_plan → done and does not livelock. (Historical
note: an earlier U6b/U3 seam had no schema field for this; the gap was closed
when `plan_step` became a validated field — see ledger_core.py's PLAN_STEPS.)

DECLARED SEVERITY MAPPING (contract §3.1, fixed property):
    P0 -> blocker;  P1 -> major;  P2 -> major;  P3 -> minor
DECLARED adapter_scale: "three-tier"
    CE's /ce-code-review emits stable P0/P1/P2/P3 that map cleanly onto all
    three shared severities, so CE skips the rubric probe (SKILL.md §"command-
    driven reviewer") and declares three-tier directly.
