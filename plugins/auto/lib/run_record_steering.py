"""auto run-record steering: the AGENT-FACING write verbs (R3/R5/R20/R21).

The steering layer of the run-record surface. Where ``run_record_mutators`` holds the
engine's own scalar mutators, this module holds the verbs a DRIVING AGENT calls to
reshape a live run: retire an obsolete step, add newly-discovered work, re-wire a
dependency, and join the ownership set that the PreToolUse hooks gate on.

Extracted from ``run_record_mutators`` when that file crossed the 1000-LOC budget. The
split is conceptual, not merely mechanical: these four verbs are the surface the
agent-native runtime exposes as tools, and they share one contract —

    read freely; write only through a verb that revalidates its precondition
    INSIDE the flock and can REJECT.

Every verb here wraps precondition + mutate + predicate-recompute in a single
``run_record_core._with_locked_run_record`` call (I-1 / KTD-2). The model never holds the
lock and never does a read-then-write across two invocations, so a slow agent
deciding against a stale snapshot has its write rejected rather than merged.
``tests/unit/steering-verbs.test.sh`` asserts that structurally, per verb, via AST.

Sits ABOVE run_record_mutators in the acyclic DAG
(core ← mutators ← steering ← facade): imports run_record_core for the lock primitive
and errors, and run_record_mutators for the two graph helpers ``add_step`` /
``reshape_deps`` reuse (``_sanitize_enumerated_depends_on``,
``_find_depends_on_back_edge``) rather than hand-rolling a second sanitizer or
cycle detector. Imports NOTHING from producers or the facade.

    The steering verb behind R3/R20, and the ONLY producer of the
    `pending -> terminal-skip` / `verdict-returned -> terminal-skip` edges. An
    agent that judges a step obsolete no longer has to contrive a dispatch
    timeout to retire it.

    ``reason`` is REQUIRED and must be non-blank (R20) — a skip is auditable,
    never silent. It is stored on the step as ``skip_reason`` and rendered by
    /auto-status. A blank/absent reason raises RunRecordError and writes nothing.
    Because the edges live in ``_FORCE_SKIP_SOURCE_STATES`` rather than
    ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS, the reason cannot be bypassed by calling `transition()`.

    ``_count_severities_by_step`` counts them regardless of state, so a blocker on
    a force-skipped step still holds ``met`` false (AE5). A never-dispatched step
    carries no findings, so skipping it CAN clear the predicate — deliberate;

    The steering verb behind R3 (an agent that discovers the plan needs one more
    step of work adds it directly, instead of re-running the plan phase). The new
    step is built through ``run_record_core._normalize_step`` — it enters the run-record
    with the SAME shape as an init-time or enumerate-time step (state defaults to
    ``pending``, the full findings/depends_on/attempt/skip_reason/… key set
    present), so no downstream reader has to special-case an agent-added step. We
    do NOT hand-assemble the step dict; the one step-builder is the SSOT for shape.

    I-1 (KTD-2): the duplicate-id check, the depends_on sanitize, the normalize
    and the append all run inside ONE ``_with_locked_run_record`` call, and the
    predicate is recomputed in that same atomic snapshot. A slow agent adding a
    step against a stale view has its write REVALIDATED and REJECTED rather than
    merged; this function performs no run-record read or write outside that closure
    (the steering-verbs lock-discipline test asserts this structurally).

    Two invariants, both enforced INSIDE the lock because either violation would
    otherwise wedge the run:
      * DUPLICATE id → rejected. Two steps sharing an id make ``_find_step``
        ambiguous (it returns the first match) and every id-keyed write becomes
        nondeterministic — that is corruption, not a recoverable stall, so we
        raise and write nothing.
      * a ``depends_on`` edge to an UNKNOWN step → rejected. Unlike
        ``set_enumerated_steps`` (which DROPS bad edges because it validates a
        whole BATCH of model output, where a raise would materialize zero work
        steps — itself a stall), ``add_step`` is a single DELIBERATE add: a bad
        edge is a caller mistake we surface loudly, not silently repair. A
        dangling edge would leave the step permanently un-``_is_ready``
        (``dep is None -> False``) — the exact silent-livelock class the
        enumerate sanitizer exists to catch — so we REUSE that sanitizer
        (``_sanitize_enumerated_depends_on``) rather than duplicate its logic and
        turn any dropped edge into a hard reject. A self-edge is reported by the
        sanitizer as ``self`` and likewise rejected (a step depending on itself
        is never ready).

    New steps are always ``pending`` — the ONLY legal birth state (every other
    state is reached along the §3 grammar). ``depends_on`` defaults to empty;
    ``phase`` defaults to ``_normalize_step``'s run-phase-derived default

        closes it), the batch-internal-only view ``set_enumerated_steps`` uses is
        insufficient here, so we widen the graph but reuse the detector verbatim

    A dispatched phase sub-agent calls this on start. Both PreToolUse hooks then
    gate it by membership of ``{driving_session_id} ∪ agent_session_ids`` instead
    of scalar equality against the boss's session — which is why the fail-closed
    destructive backstop now fires inside the sub-agent tree, where the ``fix``
    phase writes code and runs Bash.

    Membership is opt-IN by registration, never by co-location: an unrelated
    Claude session running in the same worktree is in neither key and is never
    gated (the "standalone ce-skill is not captured" dimension is preserved).

    Idempotent — re-registering an already-present id is a no-op, so a sub-agent
    that retries its own start does not grow the set. Bounded at
    ``_MAX_AGENT_SESSIONS`` so a pathological re-dispatch loop cannot grow the
    run-record without limit; the oldest entry is evicted first.

    EVICTION IS A FIFO HEURISTIC, NOT A LIVENESS GUARANTEE (adversarial/security
    review, v0.13.0). The oldest-registered id is the one MOST LIKELY already
    complete, so FIFO is a reasonable proxy for "drop the dead one" — but it is a
    proxy. A sub-agent registers ONCE at start (not per command), so a still-live
    early agent that is evicted after ``_MAX_AGENT_SESSIONS`` later distinct
    registrations falls out of the set and the destructive backstop goes dark for
    it, reverting to the prompt-carried constraints (§4.6) as the only guard. The
    cap is set well above a realistic run's session count (fan-out cap 16 per
    wave, idempotent retries don't grow the set), so eviction should never fire in
    a normal run; if it does, that run is anomalous. This is defense-in-depth
    against a MISBEHAVING agent, not a sandbox against a MALICIOUS one — an agent
    with Bash can edit the run-record JSON directly regardless.

    I-1: read + membership check + append happen inside ONE
    ``_with_locked_run_record`` call. Two sub-agents registering concurrently
    serialize; neither loses the other's id.

    CALLER-TRUST: the CLI verb accepts an arbitrary ``session_id`` arg, so it is
    the CALLER's responsibility to pass its OWN id — the §4.8 dispatch contract
    has each sub-agent register ``$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`` (its own env id), so a
    sub-agent only ever adds ITSELF. A process that passes a third party's id
    could gate that bystander (a DoS, not a destructive-command bypass); the
    env-derived contract is the mitigation.

    Does NOT touch ``driving_session_id`` — the boss remains the primary owner,
    and only the boss's session is exempt from the action gate's operator-pause
