"""auto U7: decision logic behind .claude/hooks/on-stop.sh.

The engine's OWN deliberate-stop guard (U9 spike: native `/goal` has no external
predicate seam — auto ships this). Reads every ledger under
<repo>/.claude/auto/ LOCK-FREE (atomic-rename => consistent snapshot) and
decides whether to BLOCK the stop.

BLOCK MECHANISM (U9 §4 + ralph-loop/hooks/stop-hook.sh:179-188):
    emit `{"decision":"block","reason":...}` on stdout, exit 0. NOT exit-2 — the
    codebase convention is decision-JSON + exit-0.

ACTIVE-RUN POLICY:
    BLOCK if ANY run has loop_phase != "done" AND exit_predicate_result.met ==
    false AND loop.driver == "self". `met` already encodes the all_units_terminal
    gate (schema §5 I-2), so a lurking stalled/pending unit (findings counters
    zero) keeps the stop blocked.

    The `driver == "self"` conjunct is the SEAM/MANUAL carve-out: the engine
    blocks premature stop only during ACTIVE work — a live tick chain (driver ==
    "self") that expects to keep going. When the engine writes `driver:
    "manual"` it is SIGNALING a valid stop-point awaiting human input (a
    seam pause emits action:"stop" + driver:"manual" deliberately; predicate-met
    and abort also set manual but are already filtered by phase == "done").
    Blocking a manual-driver run would self-conflict with the engine's own
    seam-stop signal. (Brief/plan stated the simpler "phase != done AND !met"
    rule, which conflicts with the seam; this carve-out resolves it — raised as a
    gap for the orchestrator.)

LOOP-SAFETY:
    Claude Code re-fires Stop after a block with stop_hook_active == true. We
    ALLOW the stop in that case (no decision JSON), surfacing a warning — the
    deterministic gate fires once per stop attempt, never an inescapable loop.

FRESHNESS: we read exit_predicate_result.met directly (the I-1-fresh field —
schema §5). No cached/derived `done` copy exists; a re-review reopening the
predicate (verdict-returned → pending) is reflected on that very write, so the
hook can never read a stale met:true and allow a premature stop.

STALE-CHAIN CARVE-OUT (Bug #9):
    The `driver == "self"` block above assumes a LIVE tick chain. But a tick can
    be killed AFTER it writes the beat and BEFORE it re-arms its successor. That
    leaves a ledger with driver=="self", met==false, and a fresh-ISH last_beat_at
    — a DEAD chain that, without a freshness check, would block EVERY session's
    stop in the repo until last_beat_at finally ages past GRACE (≈70 min, when
    is_orphaned surfaces it for resume). So we add a freshness gate: a
    driver=="self" run whose last_beat_at is older than DRIVER_SELF_STALE_SECONDS
    is treated as a DEAD chain → it does NOT block stop (it will be surfaced for
    resume by the SessionStart hook instead).

    THREE THRESHOLDS, reconciled (smallest → largest, no overlap of purpose):
      * DEFAULT_STALL_THRESHOLD_SECONDS = 600  — per-UNIT dispatch timeout (tick).
      * DRIVER_SELF_STALE_SECONDS       = 3900 — per-RUN dead-chain gate (THIS
            hook). Above the 3600s ScheduleWakeup max-tick-delay + slack, so a
            healthy slow-paced chain (last beat ≤3600s ago) is NEVER misread as
            dead and prematurely un-blocked (a false un-block could let a real
            loop stop early). Below GRACE so a dead chain stops blocking BEFORE
            is_orphaned would surface it — the two purposes (anti-false-double-
            drive vs anti-stale-block) do not fight: by the time we DECLINE to
            block (3900s), the resume path has not yet (4200s) claimed it, so
            there is a clean ~300s hand-off window and no double-claim.
      * GRACE_SECONDS                   = 4200 — orphan/resume window (I-3).
