"""auto: /auto run-creation logic behind dispatch.sh.

This is the run-creation entry point the engine otherwise lacks: it parses the
/auto argument string, creates a fresh ledger via ledger.py (so the
init-time RMW flock + I-1 predicate recompute are inherited — no new flock), and
emits an arm-first-tick INTENT (the model fires the actual ScheduleWakeup +
/goal). It mirrors resume.py's shape: parse argv positionally, route through
ledger.py, emit one JSON intent line, exit 0 on a clean surface.

Argument forms (parsed HERE, never in the .md body — Claude Code does not
dispatch space-separated subcommands, per memory
`feedback_slash_command_arg_substitution`):

    <plan-or-spec>                start a run from a plan/spec file (required).
    ... auto                      append `auto` to skip the plan->work seam
                                  pause (the tick gets --auto).
    ... --adapter ce|native       select the workflow adapter (default ce).
    ... --goal "<text>"           compound deliberate-stop goal text (the
                                  default is the loop's own exit predicate).

A new run starts at loop_phase="plan" with an EMPTY units[] — the plan-loop
(adapter-driven, via the tick) populates the work units later; /auto does
NOT parse units from the plan. init_ledger's defaults are exactly this shape.

The plan path, goal text, and `auto` flag have NO ledger field (schema §2 has
no slot for any of them, and ledger.py is the locked contract). They ride in the
EMITTED INTENT as payload the model consumes — the same intent-shape extension
resume.py uses. The model issues `/goal <text>` and `ScheduleWakeup(60,
"/auto:auto-tick <run>[ --auto]")`.

DOUBLE-DRIVE: init_ledger holds the per-run init flock across the
existence-check + write; the arm-first-tick path emits intent only — the tick's
own non-blocking process-held _tick_lock is the double-drive guard. No new flock
here. No file sentinel.

rel-001-ish: empty args / a usage surface exits 0 (surfacing, not an error);
only a genuine failure (missing plan file, ledger already exists, bad adapter)
exits non-zero so the operator sees it.
