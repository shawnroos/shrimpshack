"""auto: /auto run-creation logic behind dispatch.sh.

This is the run-creation entry point the engine otherwise lacks: it parses the
/auto argument string, creates a fresh run-record via run_record.py (so the
init-time RMW flock + I-1 predicate recompute are inherited — no new flock), and
emits an arm-first-pulse INTENT (the model fires the actual ScheduleWakeup +
/goal). It mirrors resume.py's shape: parse argv positionally, route through
run_record.py, emit one JSON intent line, exit 0 on a clean surface.

Argument forms (parsed HERE, never in the .md body — Claude Code does not
dispatch space-separated subcommands, per memory
`feedback_slash_command_arg_substitution`):

    <plan-or-spec>                start a run from a plan/spec file (required).
    ... auto                      append `auto` to skip the plan->work handoff
                                  pause (the pulse gets --auto).
    ... --backend ce|native       select the workflow backend (default ce).
                                  (`--adapter` accepted as a deprecated alias.)
    ... --goal "<text>"           compound deliberate-stop goal text (the
                                  default is the loop's own exit predicate).

A new run starts at loop_phase="plan" with an EMPTY steps[] — the plan-loop
(backend-driven, via the pulse) populates the work steps later; /auto does
NOT parse steps from the plan. init_run_record's defaults are exactly this shape.

The plan path, goal text, and `auto` flag have NO run-record field (schema §2 has
no slot for any of them, and run_record.py is the locked contract). They ride in the
EMITTED INTENT as payload the model consumes — the same intent-shape extension
resume.py uses. The model issues `/goal <text>` and `ScheduleWakeup(60,
"/auto:auto-pulse <run>[ --auto]")`.

DOUBLE-DRIVE: init_run_record holds the per-run init flock across the
existence-check + write; the arm-first-pulse path emits intent only — the pulse's
own non-blocking process-held _pulse_lock is the double-drive guard. No new flock
here. No file sentinel.

rel-001-ish: empty args / a usage surface exits 0 (surfacing, not an error);
only a genuine failure (missing plan file, run-record already exists, bad backend)
exits non-zero so the operator sees it.

def _handoff_default_notice():
    """v0.4.0 KTD-4: one-time stderr notice for the handoff-default flip.

    The handoff-pause default flipped from "pause unless `auto`" to "proceed
    unless `--review-plan`". Scripted callers that relied on the pause
    without spelling ``auto`` will now silently skip it. The notice makes
    the change discoverable.

    Marker file at ``<resolve_shared_dir>/.handoff-default-acknowledged``;
    first-run-after-upgrade emits the notice and writes the marker; every
    subsequent run is silent. Scoped to the HOST repo (not the worktree)
    so the notice doesn't re-fire per worktree under fanout — KTD-3 (the
    dependency this skill declared on U1).

    THE RENAME MOVED THE MARKER, AND A MOVED MARKER IS A RE-FIRED NOTICE.
    The concept-vocabulary rename swept this filename ``.seam-default-acknowledged``
    → ``.handoff-default-acknowledged``. But the marker is not a code identifier —
    it is a piece of USER STATE on disk, written by the previous version. Renaming
    it means every existing user's ack is silently un-acked, and the one-time
    "this default changed" notice fires a second time at someone who dismissed it a
    version ago. Nothing else in the rename touched user state without a shim; this
    did, by omission.

    So: ACCEPT EITHER marker (the old one is proof of an ack just as good as the new
    one), and MIGRATE ON READ — when only the legacy marker is found, write the new
    one before returning. This is a read-compat shim of exactly the same shape as
    lib/format_compat.py, at the smallest possible scale — and like that shim, it is
    cheap to keep and expensive to have skipped.

    The migration is what makes the legacy read DROPPABLE. Without it there is no
    re-ack path at all: a legacy-ack user never grows a `.handoff-default-acknowledged`,
    so deleting the legacy read at v0.15.0 (docs/deprecations.md step 6) re-fires this
    notice at EVERY one of them — the exact bug the shim exists to prevent, just
    deferred. With it, one post-upgrade run migrates the marker forward and the v0.15.0
    removal is genuinely silent.

    Best-effort: any IO failure swallows silently. A missing marker on a
    next run re-fires the notice; not a load-bearing correctness path. The same
    applies to the migration write — if it fails, the legacy marker is still there
    and still suppresses the notice, so the user sees nothing either way.
