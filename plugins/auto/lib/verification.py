"""auto v0.7.0 (U3): typed-verification gate engine.

Two responsibilities, both pure-stdlib (no pip — the plugin ships to arbitrary
repos via a marketplace; a third-party dep would break install-anywhere, same
constraint as lib/workflows.py):

  1. ``evaluate_programmatic(criterion, cwd)`` — RUN a `programmatic` criterion
     (argv + a `check`) and return a structured pass/fail result with bounded,
     binary-safe evidence. This is the only criterion type the engine evaluates
     in-process; model_judge / advisor_judge / human verdicts are supplied by
     the driver/work-agent as data.

  2. ``aggregate(criteria, programmatic_results, judge_verdicts)`` — a PURE
     function (KTD-6) that folds the programmatic results plus any supplied
     judge verdicts into a single gate decision, or reports which judges are
     still pending. Keeping this pure is what makes the advisor-judge path
     unit-testable without a live ``advisor`` (judge verdicts inject as data).

The criterion shape is the one validated in lib/workflows.py::_validate_verification
and documented in skills/auto-design/references/verification-taxonomy.md.
