"""auto U10: agent-managed batch fan-out for the work-loop.

The orchestration layer is *agent-driven* and deliberately separate from the
mechanical pulse (U4). The DRIVING AGENT (U5) owns the policy — it reads which
steps are ready, decides a batch cap for this wave (resizing in flight under
machine pressure), dispatches, then reconciles landed verdicts. The engine here
only exposes ready-and-independent steps and reconciles durable state; it never
hardcodes a concurrency constant (R12) and never decides how to parallelize.

Three operations (against the run-record schema contract,
docs/contracts/run-record-schema.md — read THAT, not lib/run_record.py, for the spec):

  * ``ready_steps(repo, run)``  -> the step ids dispatchable RIGHT NOW.
  * ``dispatch_batch(repo, run, step_ids, cap, *, launch_fn=None)``
        -> marks each chosen step pending->dispatched (records dispatched_at),
           launches its background agent; REJECTS any step not in `pending`
           (idempotency guard — pending->dispatched is the only entry).
  * ``converge(repo, run)``  -> a RECONCILE/READ step over durable run-record state.
           It is NOT the verdict-writer.

THE LOAD-BEARING CORRECTNESS PROPERTY (verdict survives session death)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Each dispatched background agent SELF-WRITES its own verdict into the run-record
atomically, via ``run_record.record_verdict`` (the I-1 write chokepoint). The
verdict is durable the moment the agent finishes — independent of whether the
driving session is still alive. So ``converge`` never loses a verdict to a
session death: a resumed session reads completed verdicts straight off the
run-record and does NOT re-dispatch them. The dispatcher's in-flight batch state
(which cap it chose, which handles it holds) is DISPOSABLE; only the durable
per-step run-record state matters across a resume.

``converge`` is therefore a READER by construction: this module's converge code
path imports ONLY ``read_run_record`` from the run-record — never ``transition`` /
``record_verdict`` / ``set_loop``. A future reviewer cannot add a write to
converge without adding a new write-import, which would be immediately visible.
This mirrors run_record.py's "single chokepoint" discipline for I-1.

THE AGENT-LAUNCH BOUNDARY (documented interface for U5 to wire)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For U10 we implement the orchestration + run-record interactions. The actual
background-agent launch is an INJECTED callable ``launch_fn(step_id, attempt)``;
U5's driver passes the real wrapper around an ``Agent`` ``run_in_background``
dispatch whose prompt instructs the agent to call ``run_record.record_verdict`` on
completion — passing ``attempt`` so the verdict carries the dispatch generation it
was launched for (Bug #6 attempt-identity). For tests (and a documented default)
``launch_fn`` defaults to a no-op recorder.

The launch fires ONLY AFTER the pending->dispatched transition succeeds — never
launch-then-fail-to-mark, which would orphan a verdict with nothing to link it to.

THE LAUNCH GUARD (Bug #8)
─────────────────────────
``launch_fn`` is real I/O (a background-agent spawn) and CAN raise. The launch is
wrapped in a PER-STEP try/except: a launch failure marks that step ``stalled`` with
``last_error = {call:"launch", ...}`` (reusing the ``dispatched -> stalled`` edge —
no new grammar) and records ``"launch-failed:<class>:<msg>"`` in the per-step
results, then CONTINUES the wave. Without the guard a single launch raise would
leave the step committed as ``dispatched`` with no agent running (a phantom step
recoverable only via the stall timeout) AND propagate out of the loop, abandoning
every remaining step in the wave. The burnt attempt is naturally recorded in the
step's ``attempt`` counter (incremented at dispatch); the operator can
``/auto-resume retry`` the stalled step.

ATTEMPT-IDENTITY (Bug #6)
─────────────────────────
Each ``pending -> dispatched`` transition INCREMENTS the step's ``attempt`` counter
(in the SAME atomic snapshot as the state change, via the transition's ``**fields``
— never a separate write, which would reopen a race). The launched agent carries
this attempt; ``run_record.record_verdict`` rejects a verdict whose attempt is older
than the step's current attempt (a stale verdict from a superseded retry).

    already-dispatched step in the list does not block the genuinely-pending ones,
    and one step's launch failure does not abandon the rest of the wave.

    Idempotency note: an already-``dispatched`` step fails the
    ``pending -> dispatched`` grammar edge in run_record.py (``transition`` raises
    ``InvalidTransition``), so even a race that slips past the pre-filter cannot
    produce a second ``dispatched_at`` — the transition is the authoritative

    """Reconcile durable run-record state into a cheap summary for the driver.

    A RECONCILE/READ step over durable per-step state — NOT the verdict-writer.
    Each dispatched background agent has already self-written its own verdict via
    ``run_record.record_verdict`` (atomic, I-1) the moment it finished. converge just
    READS the run-record fresh off disk and classifies steps, so a resumed session
    (one whose driving process died after agents completed) sees completed
    verdicts straight from disk and does NOT re-dispatch them.

    Returns a summary dict::

        {
          "in_flight":  [ids still "dispatched" (no verdict yet)],

        }

    The fresh-read property is the load-bearing one: between two converge calls,
    state written by ANOTHER process (an agent self-writing a verdict) is picked
    up — converge holds no in-memory batch state across calls.
