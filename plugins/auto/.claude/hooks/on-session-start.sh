# auto U7 SessionStart hook: resurrection / handoff surfacing.
#
# A self-paced ScheduleWakeup pulse chain does NOT survive a full session exit
# (in-session only; durable cron is denied by cmux). No work is lost — the
# run-record is durable on disk and each background agent self-writes its verdict
# atomically — but the lost re-arm leaves a run "orphaned" (no live driver).
# This hook SURFACES resumable runs at the start of a fresh session so the
# operator can `/auto-resume` them. It SURFACES ONLY — it never auto-runs
# (auto-resume is U8, spike-gated).
#
# For each <repo>/.claude/auto/*.json:
#   * loop_phase == "done"                          -> skip.
#   * loop_phase == "handoff" AND handoff_paused == true  -> handoff-specific hint
#     (plan complete; awaiting work confirmation). Checked BEFORE the time-based
#     orphan branch (schema §5 I-3 — handoff is the INTENTIONAL orphan).
#   * else if loop.driver == "manual" OR loop.last_beat_at older than GRACE
#     (4200s; the pulse chain died with a prior session) -> resume hint.
#
# rel-001: presence-gate first; ALWAYS exit 0 (never block session start).
# Heavy work exec'd into Python. Mirrors claude-modes/scripts/on-session-start.sh.
