#!/usr/bin/env bash
# auto U4 PreToolUse hook (destructive-action backstop): the deterministic
# irreversible-operation gate over Bash/Write.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (KTD-4/5):
#   The AskUserQuestion gate only intercepts decisions to *ask*, never decisions
#   to *act*. This second hook matches Bash command / Write content against the
#   CLAUDE.md-anchored destructive set (push --force, reset --hard, checkout .,
#   restore ., clean -f / git clean -fdx, branch -D, rm -rf, known publish
#   endpoints) and, under the SAME live-run + session_id gate, escalates via the
#   pause handoff — independent of any question. This gives the "irreversible/
#   destructive" boundary a real enforcement mechanism rather than prose the
#   agent might ignore.
#
# FAILS CLOSED (the action backstop's asymmetry vs the question gate — KTD-4):
#   on a confirmed destructive command for a confirmed live run, the hook PAUSES
#   the run (driver=manual + blocked_on) UNCONDITIONALLY — even if the deny
#   contract is unavailable. It never degrades to silent-allow on a destructive
#   match. The write happens in the sibling lib/*.py; this wrapper still always
#   exits 0 at the process level (the halt is on the run-record, not the exit code).
#
# rel-001: presence-gate first; ALWAYS exit 0 at the process level; heavy work
# exec'd into Python. Mirrors .claude/hooks/on-stop.sh.
