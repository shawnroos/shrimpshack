# auto U9 (v0.6.0) integration test: the brainstorm-rooted spine
# (workflows/pipeline.json) advances brainstorm → plan → work FORWARD, and an
# injected upstream cluster PAUSES + escalates to the operator with NO
# loop_phase change and NO new persisted run-record field.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS (KTD-6 / feedback_a1_recipe_cant_rebound_to_brainstorm):
# v0.6.0 ships the DETECTION half of the upstream-flaw problem. When review
# findings cluster on an upstream spine phase (weighting reviewer-role
# DIVERSITY over raw count), auto must NOT ratchet fix passes against a gap the
# current phase can't close — it escalates the cluster to the operator via the
# EXISTING pause handoff (driver=manual + blocked_on). The autonomous backward edge
# (rebound) is deferred to v0.7.0; this test asserts v0.6.0's narrow contract:
#   * forward advance works (the spine workflow's producers fire on arrival), AND
#   * on a detected cluster the run PAUSES (driver=manual, blocked_on names the
#     upstream phase), loop_phase is UNCHANGED (no backward move), and NO new
#     top-level run-record field is written.
#
# DELIBERATE-FAIL CONTROL (feedback_new_tests_need_deliberate_fail_smoke_check):
# the LAST scenario primes the identical work-phase run-record but withOUT the
# role-tagged cluster_findings. The work-loop MUST then take its normal fix
# advance (no pause), proving the pause in scenario 2 is caused by the cluster,
# not an artifact of the priming.
