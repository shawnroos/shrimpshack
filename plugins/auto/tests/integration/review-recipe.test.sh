#!/usr/bin/env bash
# auto v0.6.0 U11 integration test: the off-spine review recipe
# (recipes/review.json) drives a SINGLE review/fix loop to a P3-only terminal
# verdict and stops at `done` — it never auto-advances and never rebounds.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS (round-2 P2, lib/adapter-ce.py):
# recipes.test.sh already pins that review.json validates / resolves / is
# distinct from w. But the DISPATCH path was never driven: review.json's work
# unit carries `dispatch_context.adapter_op == "review"` (NOT "do_unit"), and the
# DRIVER — not the adapter, not the orchestrator — maps that adapter_op to the
# skill it launches (`review` → /ce-code-review; `do_unit` → /ce-work). This test
# drives the real engine end-to-end so the off-spine review path is locked, not
# inferred:
#   * init via `--recipe review` enters at `work` with one `review` unit whose
#     dispatch_context.adapter_op is "review" (the model-facing dispatch label —
#     driver-reference.md §7, SKILL.md §4);
#   * a clean (P3-only) verdict drives the single phase to `loop_phase == "done"`;
#   * the run NEVER leaves `work` for another phase (single-phase, no spine).
#
# DELIBERATE-FAIL CONTROL (feedback_new_tests_need_deliberate_fail_smoke_check):
# the SECOND scenario records a GATING (blocker) verdict instead of a clean one.
# The work-loop MUST then NOT reach `done` (all_units_terminal == false) — proving
# the `done` in scenario 1 is caused by the clean verdict, not an artifact of the
# single-unit recipe.
