# auto v0.3.0 U6 integration test: a2 recipe with iteration block — three
# scenarios (GREEN/ITERATE/BOUND) driving the full recipe→ledger→tick path.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS (memory feedback_plan_documents_transition_code_doesnt_wire_it):
# Unit tests on iterate_template (emitters.test.sh) and advance_iteration_loop
# (tick.test.sh) cover the iteration primitives in isolation; this file proves
# that a recipe DECLARING iteration in JSON actually drives the production
# init→tick path. Without it, the recipe→ledger→tick wire could silently
# regress to recipe-iteration-ignored (the dominant build-bug class — prose
# claims a transition the code doesn't enforce).
#
# CONTRACT (KTD §A+§B+§D — v0.3.0 U6):
#   The a2 recipe declares iteration.gate_unit="judge", iteration.emit_template
#   ="plan-candidate", iteration.bound={max_attempts:5, max_wall_seconds:900}.
#   plus emit_templates.plan-candidate={phase:"plan", invokes:{adapter_op:
#   "next_plan_step"}, id_prefix:"plan-"}. auto.run + init_ledger thread these
#   onto the ledger at init (U6 plumbing). Subsequent ticks drive:
#     - judge decision=advance → standard flow (matches v0.2.x A2 GREEN).
#     - judge decision=iterate (under bound) → atomic_iterate_step emits a new
#       plan unit (plan-4), increments iteration_attempts, resets judge to
#       pending with extended depends_on, loop stays in plan phase.
#     - judge decision=iterate (over bound) → bound_override written to
#       judge.dispatch_context, loop forced to "done" via set_loop (NOT
#       advance_to_phase, per KTD §C).
#
# STRUCTURE: init via auto.run with --recipe a2 (carries iteration to ledger);
# prime each plan unit's enumerated_units; set gaps_open=0; record_verdict +
# set_verdict_decision on judge per scenario; dispatch_tick. Assert end-state
# (loop_phase, iteration_attempts, ids of newly-emitted plan units, bound_override
# presence).
#
# Scenarios:
#   1. GREEN — judge decision=advance → no iteration fires; existing v0.2.x
#      A2 behavior reproduced. iteration_attempts stays 0. loop progresses to
#      done via standard predicate-met short-circuit.
#   2. ITERATE — judge decision=iterate (attempts < max). atomic_iterate_step
#      emits plan-4 (id_prefix "plan-" + counter 3+1=4 since 3 initial planks).
#      iteration_attempts=1. judge.state=pending. loop_phase stays plan.
#      Then advance: re-arms standard flow.
#   3. BOUND — iteration_attempts pre-seeded to max_attempts=5; judge writes
#      iterate; evaluate_decision returns "exit"/bound_breached=True.
#      advance_iteration_loop writes bound_override + set_loop(done). loop_phase
#      is "done"; judge.dispatch_context.bound_override has bound:"max_attempts".

# ─── DF Scenario 4: counter-init-seed-prevents-emit-collision ───────────────
# WHY: v0.3.0 review-round-1 surfaced a cross-reviewer P0 (ADV-1 + testing +
# correctness). When init_ledger naively seeded `iteration_emit_count = 0`,
# iterate_template's first emit produced `plan-1` — which collides with the
# recipe-declared `plan-1` unit, raising LedgerError in _apply_emit. The
# previous version of THIS test rigged the counter to 3 post-init, masking
# the bug. F0 closes it: init_ledger now scans units[] for the max numeric
# suffix matching any emit_templates[*].id_prefix and seeds to that.
#
# This DF probes BOTH directions of the contract:
#   (a) GREEN: init_ledger of a "plan-1/2/3 + id_prefix='plan-'" recipe shape
#       MUST seed iteration_emit_count=3 (proving the F0 fix is wired).
#   (b) GREEN: init_ledger of a non-iteration shape (no emit_templates) MUST
#       seed iteration_emit_count=0 (proving F0 doesn't over-fire).
#   (c) GREEN: init_ledger of a "build-clarity/build-perf + id_prefix='build-'"
#       shape (a4-like, word-suffixed) MUST seed iteration_emit_count=0
#       (proving F0's isdigit() check correctly skips non-numeric suffixes).
#
# These three cases lock the F0 invariant against silent regression: if the
# seed logic is reverted to 0, (a) fails; if the seed logic over-fires on
# missing emit_templates, (b) fails; if it greedy-matches non-numeric
# suffixes, (c) fails.
