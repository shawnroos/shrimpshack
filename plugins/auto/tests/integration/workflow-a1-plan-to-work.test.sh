# auto v0.2.0 fix-pass A.2 integration test: a1's plan→work transition fires the
# producer (T1 from fix-pass C, hoisted to A.2 as the deliberate-fail control for
# the engine rewire).
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS (memory feedback_plan_documents_transition_code_doesnt_wire_it):
# Round-1 review's P0 #1: the v0.1.x handoff handler did raw set_loop(loop_phase="work")
# and never called the new transition_and_emit primitive — the workflow topology
# was built INTO the initial run-record but the runtime ignored it. A unit test on
# transition_and_emit in isolation passes; a unit test on producers.resolve()
# passes; but neither proves that the engine ACTUALLY CALLS THEM on a real
# plan→work transition. This test does: it drives a1 from plan-done to a met
# work-loop state and asserts the producer populated the work-phase steps.
#
# STRUCTURE: prime the run-record to look like "plan step is done, enumerated_steps
# stashed, gaps_open=0" (the post-backend-handoff state), call dispatch_pulse once
# in auto mode, then read the run-record:
#   - loop_phase must have advanced past "plan" (to "work" via auto-flip)
#   - new steps must appear with phase="work" (the producer ran)
#   - the emitted step ids must match the enumerated_steps we stashed (the
#     producer actually shaped them; this isn't just an artifact of init)
#
# DELIBERATE-FAIL CONTROL (memory feedback_new_tests_need_deliberate_fail_smoke_check):
# at the END of this file, we re-run the same scenario AFTER REPLACING
# transition_and_emit with a no-op (via monkey-patch on a fresh load). The test
# MUST observe zero new work steps in that branch — proving this test FAILS
# when the wire is broken. Without that proof the green-path could be passing
# vacuously (e.g. if steps were always emitted at init).
