#!/usr/bin/env bash
# auto v0.4.3 integration test: W (work-only) finishes the deferred KTD-15 —
# a reviewed plan goes STRAIGHT to work without re-running the plan-loop.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS (memory project_auto_v042_stuck_root_causes, root cause ③):
# Before this, smart-entry detected `reviewed-plan` but routed to a1, whose
# plan-loop re-ran /ce-plan + /ce-doc-review on the already-green plan ("auto
# re-plans a finished plan"). The W recipe that should skip the plan-loop was a
# v0.2.0 stub with no plan→units enumeration. The fix makes W declare its plan
# phase `plan_presatisfied`: init sets plan_step="review_plan" + gaps_open=0 so
# the FIRST tick's next_plan_step returns "done" → enumerate_plan_units →
# plan→work, with NO plan/deepen/review pass.
#
# STRUCTURE: create a real W run via `/auto <plan> --recipe w`, assert the
# pre-satisfied ledger state, stash the model-enumerated work units (what the
# model does when it executes the enumerate_plan_units prepare op), tick once in
# auto mode, and assert the run is now in `work` with those units — proving the
# plan-loop was skipped entirely.
#
# DELIBERATE-FAIL CONTROL: a second run created WITHOUT plan_presatisfied (plain
# a1) on the same priming MUST NOT be plan-met at init — proving the green-path
# assertion is caused by the pre-satisfied init, not by something always-true.
