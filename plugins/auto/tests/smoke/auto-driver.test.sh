# auto smoke test (v0.4.0 U4): the auto-driver skill is structurally sized
# and cites the driver-reference doc instead of inlining theory.
#
# Fix-pass F (predecessor) added an OUTPUT VOICE preamble to stop agents
# narrating routing logic. v0.4.0 U4 went further — the entire preamble
# was itself the narration symptom (an agent reading "do not narrate"
# tends to narrate). The fix is structural: cut the skill surface to a
# size budget, move mechanism prose to docs/contracts/driver-reference.md,
# and let the slim body enforce brevity instead of rules-about-brevity.
#
# Asserts:
#   - skills/auto-driver/SKILL.md exists and ≤ 60 lines (U4 budget)
#   - frontmatter declares name: auto-driver
#   - cites docs/contracts/driver-reference.md (theory lives there)
#   - no OUTPUT VOICE preamble (it was the disease; cutting surface is the cure)
#   - commands/auto.md frontmatter lists Skill (the body delegates to
#     this skill via the Skill tool)
#   - commands/auto.md has EXACTLY ONE $ARGUMENTS reference
