# auto v0.7.x U4: verb-classify.py unit test.
#
# Pins the deterministic {work|plan|both|ambiguous} taxonomy over freeform args:
#   * work verbs about existing work → work (the 2026-06 field misroute #2)
#   * creation verb + "plan" noun, or "plan" as a verb, + work → both (#1)
#   * plan/design verb, no work → plan
#   * "the plan" (noun) does NOT read as plan-creation
#   * no verb signal → ambiguous (bare topics / improvement verbs → model decides)
