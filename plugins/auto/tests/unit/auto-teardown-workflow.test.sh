# auto launch-chooser (agent-native Gap 3): `auto.sh ... --teardown-workflow-after-init`
# makes auto.py delete the run-scoped WORKSPACE workflow itself, atomically once the
# run-record is initialized — so the chooser never infers "run_record initialized" from
# stdout. This pins: (a) WITH the flag the workspace workflow file is gone after a
# successful run-create and the run-record still exists; (b) WITHOUT the flag the file
# remains (the flag is what triggers teardown, not a side effect).
