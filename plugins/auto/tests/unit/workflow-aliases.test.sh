# auto U6 (R9) unit test: legible names alias the a1/a2/a4/w shorthand.
#
# A pure ALIAS layer — a legible name resolves to the SAME workflow as its
# shorthand stem; the stems and the A1_BUILTIN fallback constant are NEVER
# renamed (KTD-6). SELF-CONTAINED inline harness (same style as
# workflows.test.sh / run-record.test.sh).
#
# Legible name → stem aliases under test:
#   plan-build-review → a1      parallel-theories → a2
#   adversarial-pair  → a4      work-only         → w
#
# Scenarios:
#   1. Resolving a legible name returns the SAME workflow dict as its stem (R9).
#   2. Bare /auto still falls back to A1_BUILTIN when no a1.json resolves
#      (KTD-6 — the fallback path is intact; the alias inherits it too).
#   3. recommender routing still produces a resolvable workflow; the alias
#      round-trips (legible name resolves to the same workflow as the stem).
#   4. `recommender.py --check-agrees` agrees END TO END on an ALIAS-form
#      recommendation (not just set membership): the agent may pass the legible
#      name (skills/auto-launch §2 promotes it as primary); it must canonicalize
#      to its stem and reach the skip tier exactly where the bare stem does.
#   5. Every existing a1/a2/a4/w reference still resolves (no rename regression).
#   6. A workflow AUTHORED under a reserved alias name is rejected by validate()
#      (fail fast, not silently shadowed); the bare stems stay valid.
#   7. Drift guard: workflows._ALIASES == workflow_validate._RESERVED_ALIAS_STEMS
#      (the two copies of the reserved map can never diverge).
