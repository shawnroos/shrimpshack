# auto v0.3.0 H mechanical defense: doc-fence for the ledger-schema contract.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS (the recurring class meta-finding from round-3 review):
# Round-1 / Round-2 / Round-3 each surfaced an instance of the recurring class
# "code adds a public ledger field or mutator without documenting it in
# docs/contracts/ledger-schema.md" — same shape as the prose-vs-code mismatch
# pattern, but applied to docs/code drift. G3 closed the round-2 instance for
# the recipe-format.md side (the F4-added expected_emit_outputs field); G2
# reproduced the SAME class on the ledger side by adding `exit_reason` +
# `set_exit_reason` without touching ledger-schema.md. H (this fix-pass) closes
# the instance AND adds this mechanical defense so the class can't quietly
# recur a fourth time.
#
# Mirror of tests/unit/wikilink-check.test.sh (G5's mechanical defense for the
# wikilink-leak class). Pattern: for every public ledger surface, the docs
# MUST mention it by name; the lint greps the doc + fails on absence.
#
# Maintenance contract: when you add a new top-level ledger field OR a new
# public ledger.py function, update this lint's `REQUIRED` list AND
# docs/contracts/ledger-schema.md. The lint fails fast; the doc keeps the
# operator surface discoverable.

# The required-symbols list: every public ledger surface that the operator or
# an agent reading the docs would need. Adding a new public symbol to
# lib/ledger.py without adding it here is fine — but then this lint won't catch
# a doc-drift on that symbol. Adding it here is the load-bearing step. Keep
# the list narrow: only fields/functions an external consumer would need to
# understand. Helpers prefixed with `_` are NOT in scope.

# Order matters for readability only — the lint runs an unordered grep.
