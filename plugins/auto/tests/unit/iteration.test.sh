# auto v0.3.0 U1 unit test: the ONE iteration-decision module.
#
# Mirrors tests/unit/phase-grammar.test.sh — every site that reads a gate
# unit's verdict.decision routes through this module. AST lint (sibling
# file tests/unit/iteration-ast-lint.test.sh) mechanically enforces that
# no other lib/*.py raw-subscripts dispatch_context["decision"] — same
# discipline as phase-grammar's "loop_phase" literal lint.
#
# Behavior contract from plan U1:
#   evaluate_decision(led, gate_unit_id, now_monotonic=None) -> dict with
#     decision_effective: "advance" | "iterate" | "exit" | None
#     original_decision: <same string or None>
#     bound_breached: bool
#     bound_type: "max_attempts" | "max_wall_seconds" | None
#     attempts_made: int
#
# Test scenarios (from plan U1):
#   1. advance — decision="advance" → decision_effective="advance", not breached
#   2. iterate under bound — attempts < max → effective stays "iterate"
#   3. bound: max_attempts — attempts == max → effective forced to "exit"
#   4. bound: max_wall_seconds — active_wall_seconds > max → effective forced to "exit"
#   5. no decision yet — read_decision returns None, evaluate returns None
#   6. unknown gate unit id — raises clear error
