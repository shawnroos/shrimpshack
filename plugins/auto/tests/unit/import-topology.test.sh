# auto v0.3.1 Track C: import-topology lint — locks the DAG the B4/B5 splits
# established so future agents can't re-introduce a circular import.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS:
# B5 split lib/run_record.py into a 4-file DAG (run_record_core ← run_record_mutators ←
# run_record_producers ← run-record-facade); B4 split lib/pulse.py into pulse ←
# {pulse_advance, pulse_guidance} with pulse_advance ← pulse_guidance. Those splits
# carefully avoided cycles. But the load_lib_module loader resolves siblings at
# runtime, so a cycle wouldn't surface as an ImportError at parse time — it
# would surface as a subtle runtime failure (a half-initialized module, or a
# duplicate class identity breaking `except run_record.RunRecordError`). A future agent
# adding a "convenience import" could re-introduce one silently.
#
# This lint makes the topology grep-checkable — the same deterministic-defense
# shape as tests/unit/wikilink-check.test.sh (G5) and
# tests/unit/doc-fence-run-record-schema.test.sh (H). The DAG edges are the
# contract; this test fails the build if a forbidden edge appears.
#
# THE DAG (allowed edges only). VERIFIED AGAINST THE ACTUAL IMPORTS — F6 found this
# comment had drifted badly, and a DAG comment that lies is worse than none: the next
# agent reasons about the topology from HERE, not from the source. Re-verify with
#   grep -nE '^[a-z_]+ = load_lib_module\("|^import [a-z_]+( as [a-z_]+)?([[:space:]]|$)' lib/<mod>.py
# before you edit any line below. (The `( as …)?` alternative catches the [plain] bare
# `import y` edge from line 29 too — the old pattern only saw the aliased form and would
# have missed a future bare `import run_record_core`; it also surfaces stdlib `import os`
# lines, which are noise you eyeball past, not sibling edges.)
#
# Three EDGE KINDS, and telling them apart is the whole point of this file:
#   [top]   `x = load_lib_module("y")` at module top — the only kind `loads_sibling`
#           (and therefore every check below) can SEE.
#   [plain] a bare `import y` at module top — a real edge this lint CANNOT see.
#   [lazy]  a load INSIDE a function body — a real runtime edge, invisible to the lint,
#           and the mechanism that lets a "cycle" on paper not be one at import time.
#
#   format_compat        → (nothing)                          DAG root; pure stdlib
#   run_record_core      → format_compat [lazy], run_record_predicate [lazy]
#                          Deliberately keeps NO module-top sibling import, which is what
#                          makes it the acyclic root of the run-record family.
#   run_record_mutators  → run_record_core
#   run_record_producers → run_record_core
#   run_record_predicate → run_record_core
#   run_record_steering  → run_record_core, run_record_mutators
#   run_record (facade)  → run_record_core, run_record_predicate, run_record_mutators,
#                          run_record_steering, run_record_producers, format_compat
#                          (format_compat: U10's `downgrade` operator command. The facade
#                          owns the CLI, so the INVERSE map is loaded here; format_compat
#                          cannot host it, being unable to reach core's flock as a root.)
#
#   pulse_guidance → phase-grammar, iteration                  NOT a leaf, and NOT an
#                    importer of the run_record facade — it takes `load_run_record` as a
#                    FUNCTION from _bootstrap. The old comment claimed both.
#   pulse_advance  → phase-grammar, iteration, pulse_guidance, upstream-cluster,
#                    step_producers [plain]
#   pulse          → phase-grammar, pulse_advance, pulse_guidance
#                    The old comment claimed `pulse → iteration, step_producers,
#                    run_record`. It imports NONE of the three: it reaches that work
#                    through pulse_advance. It DOES import phase-grammar, undocumented.
#   step_producers → workflows, iteration
#                    The old comment called this a pure leaf importing nothing. It is
#                    neither: `workflows` is how a producer resolves the step template.
#
#   _bootstrap        → run_record [lazy], format_compat [lazy], phase-grammar [lazy]
#                       EVERY one is call-time, and that is load-bearing: run_record
#                       does `from _bootstrap import …` at module TOP, so a module-top
#                       `_bootstrap → run_record` edge would be a genuine import cycle.
#                       The lazy load is what keeps the back-edge legal. Do not promote
#                       any of these to a module-top import.
#   workflow_validate → format_compat                          (the validate WRITE gate)
#   workflows         → workflow_validate, format_compat       (resolve() read shim)
#   presets           → workflow_validate, backend_ops, format_compat  (load_preset shim)
#   iteration         → verification [lazy]
#
# format_compat is a DAG ROOT (pure stdlib, no sibling import), so every `→ format_compat`
# edge is a LEAF edge that closes no cycle.
#
# NB this lint is forbidden-edge / negative-grep: an ALLOWED edge missing from this
# comment does NOT turn it red. That is exactly why the comment drifted, and why the
# existence asserts below matter — they are what makes a botched rename fail loudly
# rather than silently vacate a negative grep. `loads_sibling` greps for the
# `load_lib_module("x")` call form ONLY, so it is blind to both [plain] and [lazy] edges:
# pulse_advance reaches step_producers via a PLAIN `import step_producers as producers`,
# and the existence assert is the only thing standing behind that edge.
#
# Consumers (auto.py, dispatcher.py, on-stop.py, auto-status.py, etc.) load
# the RUN-RECORD FACADE, never run_record_mutators/run_record_producers directly — the facade
# is the public surface.
