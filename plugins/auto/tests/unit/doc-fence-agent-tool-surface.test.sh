# auto unit test: doc-fence for the agent-tool-surface contract (rename plan, U7/F12).
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS:
# `tests/unit/run-record.test.sh` asserts set-equality between the CLI's `_VERBS`
# registry and what `describe` emits — so DISPATCH and the MACHINE-READABLE mirror
# can never drift. But nothing bound the third copy: the human-facing verb table in
# `docs/contracts/agent-tool-surface.md`. Grepping `agent-tool-surface` across
# `tests/` returned ZERO hits before this file — the prose contract was enforced by
# nothing.
#
# That gap was not hypothetical. U7 renamed the work-node CLI verbs
# (`set-enumerated-steps`, `add-step`) with NO aliases (KTD-4), and the rename had to
# land in the registry, the `describe` payload, and this doc IN LOCKSTEP or a driving
# agent would read a contract naming verbs that exit 2. The audit
# (`vocabulary-audit.test.sh`, which scans `docs/contracts/`) catches a STALE OLD term
# in the doc — but it cannot catch a verb that is simply MISSING, or one renamed to a
# spelling the doc never learned. This fence closes that.
#
# It also immediately caught a REAL pre-existing drift: `transition` has always been
# in `_VERBS` but was never named in agent-tool-surface.md.
#
# HOW IT WORKS: the required set is DERIVED from `python3 lib/run_record.py describe`
# (hence from `_VERBS`), never hand-maintained here — so adding a verb wires its doc
# requirement automatically. Same deterministic-defense shape as
# tests/unit/doc-fence-run-record-schema.test.sh and tests/unit/wikilink-check.test.sh.
