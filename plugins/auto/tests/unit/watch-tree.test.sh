#!/usr/bin/env bash
# auto U4 unit test: lib/watch_tree.py — the deterministic agent-tree renderer.
#
# render_agent_tree(run-record, now) turns a live run-record into a compact ASCII tree
# of driver -> work step -> do_step fan-out agent, annotating each dispatched
# node with age-vs-threshold + attempt, and nesting do_step children under their
# producer parent. It is PURE (now is passed in as an ISO-8601 string, never
# datetime.now()) so a fixed run-record + fixed now yields byte-identical output.
#
# SELF-CONTAINED inline harness (same style as workflows.test.sh): fixtures are
# built as minimal run-record dicts with a PINNED `now`, so age/over-age/determinism
# are fully controlled (no wall-clock).
#
# Scenarios (mapped to the U4 plan):
#   1. nests a do_step child under its parent fan-out step
#   2. flags a past-threshold dispatched node as over-age (age > threshold)
#   3. shows the attempt count for a dispatched node
#   4. BYTE-IDENTICAL output for a fixed run-record + fixed now (determinism)
#   5. empty/no-dispatched run-record renders the empty-tree sentinel
