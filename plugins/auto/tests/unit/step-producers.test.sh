#!/usr/bin/env bash
# auto U5b unit test: lib/step_producers.py (3 producers + registry) and the
# run_record.transition_and_emit primitive (atomic emit).
#
# v0.3.0 / U3 additions: iterate_template producer scenarios + judge_winner
# gate-step generalization + backward-compat fallback + counter-integration
# through emit_within_phase.
#
# SELF-CONTAINED inline harness.
#
# Scenarios:
#   1. registry ↔ validator consistency: producers.REGISTRY keys == workflows.V1_PRODUCER_NAMES
#   2. plan_output_to_work_steps: 1 plan step's enumerated_steps → N work steps
#   3. plan_output_to_work_steps: empty enumerated_steps → [] (vacuous, no crash)
#   4. judge_winner_to_work_steps: emits the WINNER's enumerated_steps
#   5. judge_winner_to_work_steps: no winner in findings → raises (hard error)
#   6. plan_output_to_paired_builders: 2 biased builders + comparator depends_on both
#   7. transition_and_emit: emits + advances + recomputes atomically within ONE
#      _with_locked_run_record body; a reader BETWEEN the emit and the advance sees
#      a consistent (predicate-recomputed-post-emit) snapshot — there is no
#      torn intermediate state (G3/F2 property). Narrower than "one write": no
#      external observer can witness new-phase-without-new-steps OR
#      new-steps-without-recomputed-predicate.
#   8. producers are pure: a registry producer never calls a run-record mutator (smoke:
#      transition_and_emit with a real producer completes without deadlock)
#   9. iterate_template happy: 3 plan-* steps, counter=3, emit_count=1 → plan-4
#  10. iterate_template happy: emit_count=2 → plan-4, plan-5
#  11. iterate_template counter-resume: counter=7, steps plan-1..plan-4, emit_count=1 → plan-8
#  12. judge_winner generalized: iteration.gate_step="custom_judge", no "judge" step → still emits
#  13. judge_winner backward-compat: no iteration field, step "judge" exists → still emits
#  14. iterate_template no-iteration: run-record lacks iteration field → raises
#  15. iterate_template missing counter: legacy run-record w/o iteration_emit_count → defaults to 0
#  16. emit_count validation: 0, 11, "five", -1, 1.5, True all raise
#  17. iterate_template bad template ref: emit_template names unknown key → raises
#  18. integration: emit_within_phase + iterate_template → counter advances atomically
