# auto launch-chooser: lib/launch-mode.{py,sh} — the deterministic
# interactive-vs-headless handoff (R11 / AE6 / KTD-5).
#
# The chooser silent-applies (never enters AskUserQuestion) for a self-driven /
# headless run, and shows for an interactive operator. This pins that decision
# at the shell boundary so a future SKILL edit can't silently drop the guard.
#
# Rule under test:
#   - no CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID            -> headless (no operator present)
#   - session owns a LIVE self-driven run  -> headless (autonomous launch)
#   - otherwise (operator, no owned live self-driven run) -> interactive
