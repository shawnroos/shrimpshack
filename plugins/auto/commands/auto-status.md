Show the ledger and health of an auto run.

`/auto-status` reads the durable ledger at
`<repo>/.claude/auto/<run-slug>.json` and reports the loop phase, the
cached exit-predicate result (blockers / majors / minors / gaps_open and
whether it is met), per-unit states, the driver (`self` while a tick chain
is self-pacing, `manual` when paused awaiting resume), and liveness
(`last_beat_at` vs the orphan GRACE). It surfaces stalled units with their
`last_error` cause and, at exit, the remaining minors report for operator
promotion.

It is read-only — it never mutates the ledger or arms a tick.

## Argument handling (orchestrator routes BEFORE invoking the script)

Inspect the argument string and route as follows:

1. **Empty** — invoke the script with no args; it resolves the most recent
   run in the repo, or prints usage if none exists. (Safe bare default.)

2. **Looks like a run id** (kebab-case slug, no spaces, e.g.
   `feat-foo-2026-05-21`) — invoke the script with the id verbatim.

3. **Freeform sentence** (e.g. "how's the latest run going?", "show me the
   auth one", "status of yesterday's run") — interpret intent:
   - If clearly the most recent / active run → invoke with no args.
   - If a specific run is named or implied AND only one ledger matches →
     invoke with that resolved run id.
   - If multiple ledgers could match (e.g. "the auth one" with two
     matching runs) → `AskUserQuestion` listing the candidates with the
     most-recent one as Recommended, then invoke with the chosen id.
   - If intent is unparseable → `AskUserQuestion` offering the recent
     runs (read `ls -t <repo>/.claude/auto/*.json` first).

Status is read-only, so picking the wrong run is harmless — bias toward
acting without asking when the recent-run interpretation is plausible.

## Dispatch

If the argument string is empty or a clean run-id pass-through, run the dispatch
line below directly (the harness substitutes the argument string before bash
runs):

`bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/auto-status.sh" "$ARGUMENTS"`

If you resolved a freeform sentence into a specific run id, call Bash
explicitly with the resolved id rather than going through the
substitution path:

```
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/auto-status.sh" "<resolved-run-id>"
```
(do NOT include this as a literal line in your response — invoke the Bash
tool with the constructed command.)
