Start a new auto run — the workflow-agnostic pulsed loop engine.

## Dispatch

Two branches.

1. **Argument string contains NEITHER `--workflow` NOR its deprecated alias
   `--recipe`** (covers bare `/auto`, freeform sentences, and plan-only
   flag-form). Load
   the `auto-driver` skill via the Skill tool. The skill loads the
   hypothesis JSON from `lib/auto-detect.sh`, surfaces one action
   line, dispatches when ambiguity is null, or asks one blocking
   question when it isn't. Pass the operator's argument string through.
   For interactive launches the driver now routes the in-scope
   situations (`reviewed-plan` and freeform intent) through the
   `auto-launch` launch chooser before dispatch — a worked-out loop
   recommendation the operator confirms, or a silent-apply by
   construction on self-driven / headless runs (the `driving_session_id`
   ownership gate). Run-selection and `conversation-context` paths are
   unchanged; branch 2 (`--workflow`) is unchanged.

2. **Argument string contains `--workflow`** (explicit power-user form
   — the operator already chose a workflow). Pass straight to the
   dispatch line below.

   **The deprecated alias `--recipe` routes HERE TOO** (KTD-4). It must,
   and this is load-bearing: `lib/auto.py` accepts `--recipe` and emits
   the deprecation notice, but it only ever sees the argument string if
   this branch forwards it. If the alias fell into branch 1 instead, the
   driver would treat the run as "no workflow chosen", re-derive a shape,
   and **silently run a different workflow than the operator named** —
   with no notice, because the parser was never reached. Match both
   spellings here; `lib/auto.py` normalizes.

`bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/auto.sh" "$ARGUMENTS"`

That single dispatch line is the ONLY `$`-bearing line in this file
(memory `feedback_slash_command_arg_substitution`). All other routing
lives in the `auto-driver` skill; theory + edge cases live in
`docs/contracts/driver-reference.md`.

## Environment variables (operator levers)

- `CLAUDE_AUTO_DISABLE_ITERATION=1` — kill-switch for outcomes-gated
  iteration. When set, `advance_iteration_loop` short-circuits and
  the run exits through the standard predicate-met path. Use for
  emergency rollback of a misbehaving workflow without redeploying.
- `CLAUDE_AUTO_PROVISIONAL_TTL=<seconds>` — TTL for provisional batch
  sidecars during fanout (default 600s). Discovery-time sweep drops
  older ones, recovering ports leaked by a crash between worktree
  creation and sidecar commit.
- `CLAUDE_AUTO_INFLIGHT_TTL_SECONDS=<seconds>` — staleness threshold for a
  single in-flight run on bare `/auto` (default 86400 / 1 day; floored at 0 =
  "always ask"). A run idle within the window auto-resumes silently; an older
  (or future-dated) run prompts resume-vs-start-fresh instead. Raise it to make
  long-lived runs keep silent-resuming.
- `CLAUDE_AUTO_GIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=<seconds>` — timeout for the detector's
  per-invocation `git rev-parse` worktree-root probe (default 5). On timeout the
  resolver degrades to cwd so a sick filesystem can't wedge the read-only
  detector.

## Conversation-driven entry (v0.6.0; freshness-aware v0.8.0)

Bare `/auto` after a rich conversation — no in-flight run and no *live* plan —
routes through branch 1 into the `auto-driver` skill. When the driver judges the
current session worth acting on, it sets the env var
`CLAUDE_AUTO_CONVERSATION_SIGNAL` before loading the hypothesis; the detector
then emits the `conversation-context` situation. As of v0.8.0 this preempts a
plan set that is entirely STALE (old `docs/plans/` clutter) — but a FRESH plan
still wins over the conversation. The driver classifies the
session (its own transcript plus a ~2-day `ce-sessions` lookback — never raw
compaction text), calls `lib/recommender.py` for a ce-family recommendation, and
either dispatches the entry workflow with an `auto-author-goal` phase goal or, when
the recommendation is low-confidence or ambiguous, escalates to the operator with
one question BEFORE dispatching (no run is created). See `auto-driver` /
`driver-reference.md` §11 for the full procedure.

## Advisor gate (v0.6.0)

While a self-driven run owns this session, a PreToolUse hook denies any
`AskUserQuestion` and redirects the driver to consult the `advisor` tool, then
classify the question itself: a mechanical clarification is resolved
autonomously; a substantive design/architecture fork is escalated to the
operator via the pause handoff. A second PreToolUse hook deterministically pauses
the run on an irreversible/destructive Bash/Write (the CLAUDE.md-anchored set).
Both gates fire ONLY for the driving session (matched by `driving_session_id`,
recorded at arm time) — a concurrent standalone ce-skill in the same worktree
is never intercepted. Every advisor resolution and every backstop denial is
appended to the run-record's `advisor_audit` record and surfaced in the exit
report. `advisor` is in `allowed-tools` for this reason. Full behavior:
`skills/auto/SKILL.md` §4.6.

## v0.4.0 handoff-default flip (KTD-4)

`/auto <plan>` now PROCEEDS past the plan→work handoff by default. Pass
`--review-plan` to opt in to the pause for first-pass plans where you
want to inspect the planned steps before work fans out. The legacy
`auto` positional token still parses (no-op against the new default)
so scripted callers keep working without forced rewrites. A one-time
stderr notice fires on the first post-upgrade run.
