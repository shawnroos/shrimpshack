# ClawCrush Scanner Engine
# Outputs JSON for process zombies and repo slop.
# The Claude agent handles UX — this script is a pure data source + executor.
#
# Usage:
#   crush.sh scan [--global]                  — scan CWD (or global) for zombies + slop
#   crush.sh contention                       — READ-ONLY load-contention report
#   crush.sh classify <pid> [scan_root]       — report one pid's classification (read-only)
#   crush.sh session-re <command line>        — is this a live-claude session shape? (read-only)
#   crush.sh kill [--consent <pid>]... <pid>… — kill processes, enforcing the kill matrix
#   crush.sh delete --root <path> <file>...   — delete files, contained under <root>
#   crush.sh setup-launchagent                — install/verify hourly LaunchAgent
#   crush.sh cron                             — REPORT-ONLY dry run: logs would-kill candidates
#
# CRON IS REPORT-ONLY. It kills nothing. Every line it emits is prefixed `Cron dry-run:`.
#
# SAFETY MODEL — age is never sufficient to call a process a zombie. Two axes decide:
#   liveness  — ppid == 1 AND NOT a daemon. ppid==1 alone is NOT orphanhood: launchd-managed jobs
#               and self-daemonizing session hosts (tmux, screen, pm2) are ppid==1 for their whole
#               life. Daemonhood is decided by POSITIVE signals (launchctl membership, a session-
#               host name, a live-claude command shape) — never by inferring it from the cwd.
#   ownership — owning worktree (lsof cwd -> git toplevel) AND owning claude session. A live
#               session that is not MINE outranks the worktree — sessions share repo roots.
#
#                        | orphan (ppid=1)        | attached (live parent)
#   ---------------------+------------------------+------------------------------
#   my worktree          | safe_kill              | consent_required
#   another worktree     | safe_kill (+ reported) | protected — NEVER KILL
#   another live session | safe_kill              | protected — NEVER KILL (any worktree)
#   owner unknown        | see below              | consent_required (fail closed)
#
# "owner unknown + orphan" splits on the session-child signature:
#   named MCP server / dev-stack process  -> safe_kill (its session is provably gone)
#   cwd was resolved but has been DELETED -> safe_kill (the worktree it lived in is gone)
#   generic runtime, cwd exists, no owner -> protected (launchd/daemon shape; never killed)
#   cwd unreadable at all                 -> protected (fail closed)
#
# `protected` is refused unconditionally — no flag, including --consent, unlocks it.

# Which ancestor command shapes count as a LIVE Claude session. This is the one fuzzy seam in
# the model — the crisp decision (the kill matrix) is fully deterministic downstream.
#
# The previous pattern required `claude` to be followed by whitespace or end-of-string, so it
# matched the pty-host WRAPPER (".../MacOS/claude --bg-pty-host …") but NOT the agent process that
# actually spawns MCP servers, whose command window is a bare PATH:
#
#   /Users/x/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.207     ← `claude` is followed by `/`. NO MATCH.
#
# For an interactive session that was survivable — the walk continued past the agent and hit the
# wrapper. But a swarm/subagent session (`versions/2.1.207 --agent-id …`) is parented by tmux, so
# the version binary is the ONLY claude process in the chain and the walk fell through to ppid 1.
# Measured on this machine: 46 of 76 live MCP servers reported owning_session:null. The session
# axis was dead for exactly the processes it exists to attribute.
#
# So: match `claude` as a path COMPONENT (allowing a trailing `/`), plus the version-binary shape.
# Over-matching here is safe by construction — a spurious session hit only ever moves a process
# toward `protected` (see classify_pid), never toward safe_kill.
#
# Verified live shapes (all four are pinned by a table-driven runtime test):
#   /Users/x/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.207
#   /Users/x/.local/share/claude/ClaudeCode.app/Contents/MacOS/claude --bg-pty-host …

# The bar is narrow and specific: killing a mid-flight INSTALL corrupts node_modules and the
# lockfile, and killing a language server takes the editor down with it. Nothing else qualifies.
#
# `npm exec` (i.e. npx) deliberately does NOT belong here, even though it is an npm subcommand:
# it is how most MCP servers are launched (`npm exec mcp-remote …`), so allowlisting it would make
# every npx-launched MCP server permanently unkillable — including genuinely orphaned ones, which
# are exactly what clawcrush exists to reclaim. An over-broad allowlist entry is a precision leak

# SESSION HOSTS — process supervisors that HOST other people's live work. Refused unconditionally,

# inside it.
#
# These exist because ppid==1 is a LIFECYCLE fact, not an abandonment fact, and the previous
# discriminator ("a daemon's cwd is never a git worktree") is simply false for this class. Verified
# live on this machine: the claude-swarm tmux servers (`tmux -L claude-swarm-… new-session …`) are
# ppid==1 for their entire life — tmux daemonizes by design, so launchd is their INTENDED parent —
# and their cwd resolves to the worktree the swarm was launched from. That satisfied
# `orphan && owner != ""`, so classify_pid returned safe_kill and `crush.sh kill <pid>` would have
# SIGTERMed a tmux server with live Claude sessions inside it.
#
# Membership is by NAME, checked on the command window, and it short-circuits BEFORE any cwd is
# consulted. That is the point: cwd is not a sound liveness discriminator, so the fix cannot be
# another cwd rule. `screen`, `pm2` and `sshd` are the same shape (self-daemonizing supervisors of
# other people's sessions); `launchd` itself is here so pid 1 can never be named.

#   LIVENESS  — ppid == 1 is NECESSARY for abandonment and NEVER SUFFICIENT. It is a LIFECYCLE

#               and any `nohup … & disown`'d dev server are ppid==1 for their ENTIRE LIFE. So a
#               kill also requires POSITIVE PROOF of abandonment — a deleted cwd, an MCP-server
#               signature, or a dev-stack/headless-browser process holding no listening socket.
#               Absent proof: protected. See classify_pid.
#   OWNERSHIP — which worktree owns the process (lsof cwd -> git toplevel), and which live
#               claude session, if any, is its ancestor. Ownership NEVER testifies to abandonment;
#               inferring that from a cwd is the defect that produced four consecutive P0s.

# Age is NOT an axis. It is metadata and the cron gate. A long-running `ng serve` is by
# definition old and by definition alive — that is the whole point.
#

# AUTOMATION BROWSER — a CONJUNCTION over the raw command, and the only place in this file that is

#
# The generic-runtime category (`chrome`, `node`, `bun`) cannot authorize a kill: a bare `chrome` at
# ppid==1 is indistinguishable from the user's Dock-launched browser, and a bare `node` could be a
# build watcher, an MCP server, or agent-browser. But a LEAKED automation browser is real toil, and
# dropping it entirely would leave U2 unable to see the thing it was built for.
#
# `command_window` stops at the first `-` token by design (F7: matching on the full ps line lets any
# process whose ARGS merely mention a pattern get flagged), so `--headless` is invisible to every
# pattern list — putting it in DEV_PATTERNS is dead code, which is exactly the trap this comment
# exists to stop the next person falling into. It has to be read off the raw command.
#
# Why this conjunction is sound where a bare flag match would not be:
#   - The window must ALREADY be a browser, so `nvim --headless` (a real scripting idiom) cannot hit.
#   - `--headless` specifically. NOT `--remote-debugging-port`: the user's own Chrome carries that
#     one, so keying on it would classify their real browser safe_kill.

# THE LIVENESS VETO. A process (or any descendant) holding a LISTENING TCP socket is, by definition,
# serving someone — so it is not abandoned, whatever its ppid says.
#
# This is a BEHAVIOURAL signal, and that is the whole point. Rounds 2 and 3 both tried to carve out
# daemons by NAME (a cwd rule, then a session-host list), and both failed on the first daemon nobody
# had thought to enumerate. "Is it serving traffic right now?" is a question about the process
# itself, so it holds for daemons that are not on any list — including ones that do not exist yet.
#
# Only consulted for orphaned dev-stack candidates, so the lsof cost is bounded to a handful of pids
# on a box whose defining condition is that it is already contended.
#
# ── POLARITY. Read this before touching anything below. ──
# This predicate's job is to PREVENT a kill, so its uncertain paths must resolve to "assume it is
# serving" (return 0). Every `return 1` is a claim of PROOF that nothing is listening. Getting this
# backwards does not make the veto weaker — it silently deletes it.
#
# It was backwards on arrival, and it undid the entire commit it shipped in:
#
#   lsof -nP … -p "$plist" | grep -q LISTEN
#
# `lsof` exits 1 if ANY pid in -p is not found — EVEN WHEN it successfully printed the LISTEN lines.
# Under this file's `set -o pipefail` (line 42), the pipeline takes lsof's status, not grep's, so the
# LISTEN line is found and then thrown away. Reproduced against a real listener (pid 747):
#   lsof PRINTED a LISTEN line? YES     lsof EXIT status: 1
#   veto as written (pipefail on)  -> FAILS OPEN -> safe_kill
#   identical call, pipefail off   -> fires      -> protected
# Two triggers, one root cause: (a) an unreaped zombie child, and (b) a pid_tree_of snapshot race —
# `ps` snapshots the tree, `lsof` runs later, and any descendant exiting in that window is enough. A
# dev-server tree spawns short-lived children constantly, so (b) is an intermittent SIGTERM of a live
# server that no deterministic test would ever reproduce.
#
# So: trust what lsof PRINTED, never its exit status, and fail closed on every ambiguity.

#     to zero — the exact failure the veto, the lsof rework and do_kill's default-deny each hit here.
#   - A dead ancestor cannot hide a live session: if a grandparent dies the parent reparents to 1
#     immediately, so the walk still terminates correctly.
#   - The genuine gap: a TRANSIENT `ps` failure on the one ancestor that IS the session (line
