#!/usr/bin/env bash
# setup.sh — the gateway plugin's setup path (plan U2 onward).
#
#   setup.sh acquire      fetch, build and promote the latest gateway release
#
# This file grows one verb per unit; U2 owns `acquire` and nothing else.
#
# CONTRACT (KTD2 owns it; this file implements it, it does not redefine it):
#   exactly one JSON object on stdout, ALWAYS, including every failure path;
#   diagnostics on stderr only. Every object carries ok, error and exit_code.
#
# EXIT CODES. KTD17 adds exactly two codes to the plugin's enum — 8 and 9 — so
# this file MINTS NOTHING NEW and maps its own failures onto what already
# exists. The mapping is stated here so the later setup units adopt it instead
# of re-deriving it:
#   0 ok · 2 usage, or a REFUSAL this script makes on its own invariants (a
#   staging directory that is not a complete install) · 3 could not produce a
#   runnable install: the release lookup, the download, the extract or the build
#   failed · 8 operator confirmation required (U4+) · 9 a prerequisite binary is
#   missing.
#
# WHY A STAGING DIRECTORY, AND WHY IT LIVES WHERE IT DOES (KTD4)
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# resolve_install_dir in spawnctl.sh picks the HIGHEST-VERSION ~/gateway-*
# directory and dies if THAT directory holds no runnable binary. There is no
# fallback to an older working install. So building in place under the final
# version name has two failure modes, both of which hit every OTHER process on
# the machine while the build runs:
#   * before the binary lands, every concurrent status/lens/launch resolves the
#     half-made directory and exits 3 — "no gateway install found" on a machine
#     that has a perfectly good one;
#   * after the binary lands but before the config does, resolution SUCCEEDS,
#     the probe reads an empty token out of the missing config, presents it to
#     the still-running old gateway, is refused, and reports exit 7 — pointing
#     the operator at an authentication problem that does not exist.
# Hence: build somewhere the `gateway-*` glob cannot match, and become visible
# in ONE atomic move that happens only when the directory is already complete.
#
# The staging directory sits under $SEARCH_ROOT (dot-prefixed, so the glob
# cannot see it) rather than under $TMPDIR, and that is deliberate: on a real
# machine $TMPDIR and $HOME are different filesystems, where `mv` degrades to
# copy-then-delete — which is precisely the slow, half-visible directory this
# whole design exists to prevent. Same filesystem is what makes the move atomic.
#
# set -e is deliberately OFF (only -u -o pipefail). Every failure path here is
# an exit code the contract names; letting bash exit on the first non-zero
# command would turn a classified 9 or 3 into an unclassified 1 with no JSON.
